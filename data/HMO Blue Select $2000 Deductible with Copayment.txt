HMO Blue Select  
$2,000 Deductible with Copayment  
This is the Schedule of Benefits  that is a part of your Subscriber Certificate . This chart describes the cost 
share amounts that you will have to pay for covered services. It also shows the benefit limits  that apply for 
covered services. Do not rely on this chart alone. Be sure to read all parts of your Subscriber 
Certificate to understand the requirements you must follow to receive all of your coverage. You 
should also read the descript ions of covered services and the limitations and exclusions that apply 
for this coverage . All words that show in italics are explained in Part 2 . To receive coverage, you must 
obtain your health care services and supplies from covered  providers  who partici pate in your health 
plan’s provider network. Also, for some health care services, you may have to have an approved referral 
from your primary care provider or approval from your health plan in order for you to receive coverage 
from your health plan. These requirements are  fully outlined in Part 4. If a referral or an approval i s 
required, you should make sure that you have it before you receive your health care service. Otherwise, 
you may have to pay all costs for the health care service.  
This health plan i s a limited provider network plan.  
Your health plan has a  limited provider network  called  HMO Blue Select . This limited network plan 
provides access to a network that is smaller than the full HMO Blue network. Under this plan, members  
have access to network benefits only from the providers in the HMO Blue Select network. Please consult 
the HMO Blue Select network provider directory to determine which providers are included in the limited 
network. The service area  where your covered services  will be furnishe d includes all counties in 
Massachusetts, except Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket Counties. See Part  1 for information about how 
to find a provider in your health care network.  
You have access to emergency medical services from any provider.  When you have an emergency 
medical condition, y ou should receive care at the nearest emergency room.  If you receive emergency  
medical care at an emergency room of a hospital that does not participate in your health care network, 
your health plan will provide the same co verage that you would otherwise receive if you had gone to a 
hospital that does participate in your health care network. These requirements are  fully outlined in Part 3. 
The following definitions will help you understand your cost share amounts and how the y ar e calculated.  
•A deductible  is the cost you may have to pay for certain covered services  you receive during your
annual coverage period before benefits are paid by the health plan. This chart shows the dollaramount of your deductible  and the covered se rvices  for which you must first pay the deductible .
•A copayment  is the fixed dollar amount you may have to pay for a covered service , usually when you
receive the covered service. This chart shows the times when you will have to pay a copayment .
•A coinsura nce is the percentage (for example, 20%) you may have to pay for a covered service. This
chart shows the times, if there are any, when you will have to pay coinsurance .
Your cost share will be calculated based on the allowed charge  or the provider’s actual  charge if it is less 
than the allowed charge . You will not have to pay charges that are more than the allowed charge  when 
you use a covered  provider who participates in your health care network to furnish covered services. Schedule of Benefits  (contin ued)  HMO Blue Select

happens, the change is described in a rider . Be sure to read each rider (if there are any) that applies to 
your coverage in this health plan to see if it changes this Schedule of Benefits .

Prescription Drugs  
This rider  modifies the terms of your health plan. Please keep this rider  with your Subscriber Certificate 
for easy reference.  
The outpatient  benefits described in your Subscriber Certificate for covered drugs and supplies have bee n 
changed.  
When you buy a covered  drug, the pharmacist will give you a generic equivalent of the prescribed drug 
whenever it is allowed. If you choose to buy the brand -name drug instead of the generic drug equivalent, 
your out -of-pocket costs will be more. For these covered brand- name drugs, your cost will be calculated 
based on your benefits for the generic drug equivalent. This means that your cost share amount 
(copayment  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies) will be the same cost share amou nt that you would 
have paid for the covered generic drug equivalent.  
In addition to your cost share amount , you must pay the difference  between  the allowed charge for the 
brand- name drug and the allowed charge  for the generic drug equivalent . All costs  that you pay fo r these 
covered drugs will count towards your out -of-pock et maximum.  
Important Note:  When your plan option includes a deductible  that a pplies for prescription drugs, th is 
provision does not  apply un til the deductible  has been met.

Reproductive Health Care Services

furnished for you by a covered provider in a location where it is legal to perform such ser vices . As 
required by state  law, this cover age includes : supplies , care and services of a m edical , behavioral health , 
mental health , surgical , psychiatric, ther apeutic , diagnostic , prevent ive, rehabilitative or supportive nature  
relating to preg nancy; contracep tion; assisted reproduction;  miscarriage management ; or termination of

Except as described below  for abortion and abortion -related care,  your coverage for covered reproductive 
health care services is provided to the same extent a s coverage is provided for similar covered services  to 
treat other physical conditions . (Your Schedule of Benefits describes your cost share amount. Also  refer to 
riders— if there are any —that apply to your coverage in this health plan.)  
Abortion  and Abo rtion-Relate d Care  
This health plan covers  abortion and abor tion-related care when the services are furnished for you by a 
covered provider in a location where it is legal to perform such services . Coverage for an abortion

Cost Share  Assistance Pharmacy Prog ram 
This rider  modifies the terms of your health plan. Please keep this rider  with your Subscriber Certificate 
for easy reference.  
The outpatient  benefits described in your Subscriber Certificate  for covered drugs a nd supplie s have been 
changed.  
Your health plan includes a cost share  assistance program  for certain specialty drugs and/or supplies . Cost 
share assistance is a process in which  the health plan facilitates your  enrollment in  a program where  drug 
manufactur ers provide financial support to members  by reducing  or removing  cost share applied to a drug 
and/or suppl y. 
For covered drugs  and supplies that are eligible under  this cost share  assistance program , the initial cost 
share amou nt that is provided will be  equal t o 30% of the tota l cost of the drug or supply.  
When you enroll for cost share assistance with a  drug manufacture r for an eligibl e covered drug or 
supply, the initial cost share amount  will be  either reduced or removed. In these cases,  cost share 
assistance  is provided  by a drug manufacturer  on the initial cost share . This means that your final cost 
share amount will be  calculated based off of the initial cost share  amount  minus the drug manufacturer ’s 
cost share assistance. The final cost share amou nt that you will pay is described in the cost share 
assistance drug list . 
If you choose not to enroll for cost share assistance with a drug manufacturer  for an eligible covered drug 
or sup ply, the initial cost share amount  will not  be reduced  or removed and your cost share amount will be 
higher . This mean s that the final cost share amount  that you will pay is  equal to 30% of the tota l cost of 
the drug or supply . 
There may be times when you ca nnot enr oll for cost share assistance with  a drug manufactur er for a 
certain covered drug or suppl y that may otherwise be eligible  unde r this cost share  assistance program . 
Some examples of when this will occur  include (but are not limi ted to) : when the drug or supply is  not 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat your condition ; or, when  the drug or suppl y has 
specif ic age restrictions  that you do not meet . In these  cases, the provis ions of this cost share assistance 
program will not apply, and you will pay the cost share amou nt that applies for all oth er covered drug s 
and supplies  as described in  your  Schedule of Benefits and/or ri ders. 
The cost share amount s that you pay for these  drugs  and supplies  as described above  will count toward 
your out-of-pocket  maxim um. 
To obta in the  cost share assistance drug  list that describe s the drugs and/or supp lies eligible for cost  share 
assistance  and their applica ble cost sha re, you can call the B lue Cross Blue  Shield HMO Blue  customer 
service office.  The toll- free phone num ber is shown on your ID c ard. Or, you may l og on to the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield  HMO Blu e internet Web sit e at www. bluecrossma. org. The list of these specialty 
drugs and supplies may change  from time to time . 
This rider  does not change the cost share amount that yo u will pay f or al l oth er cov ered drug s and 
supplies . Refer to your Schedule of Be nefits and/or riders for your cost share amount for other cove red 
drugs and supplies .

Dental Blue Policy  
BCBS -DENT (1 -1-2014) 
 Page 1 
 dEB19PYSoB- 0117 Schedule of Dental Benefits 
Pediatric Essential Benefits 
 
This is the Schedule of Dental Benefits  that is a part of your Dental Blue Policy . This schedule describes 
the dental services that are covered by your Dental Blue Policy for members who are eligibl e for pediatric 
essential dental benefits. It also shows the cost -sharing amounts you must pay for these covered  services . 
Do not rely on this schedule alone. You should read all parts of your Dental Blue Policy to become 
familiar with the key points. Be s ure to read the descriptions of covered services and the limitations 
and exclusions.  You should keep your Dental Blue Policy and this Schedule of Dental Benefits  handy so 
that you can refer to them. The words that are shown in italics have special meanings . These words are 
explained in Part 8 of your Dental Blue Policy. 
Who Is Eligible for Pediatric Essential Dental Benefits 
The dental benefits described in this Schedule of Dental Benefits  are provided for a member  only until the 
end of the calendar month i n which the member  turns age 19. 
Annual Deductible 
Your deductible  each plan year: $50 per member  (no more than $150 for three or  
more members  who are eligible for pediatric 
essential dental benefits and who are enrolled under 
the same family membership)  
The deductible  is the cost you have to pay during the annual coverage period (as shown above) before 
benefits will be paid. T he deductible  applies to Group 2 and Group 3 services only. A deductible  does not 
apply to Group 1 services or to Orthodontic services. See the chart that starts on the next page for how 
much you pay for covered services  you receive after you meet the deductible  (when it applies) . 
Annual Out-of-Pocket Maximum 
Your out-of-pocket maximum  each plan year: $350 per member  (no more than $ 700 for two or 
more members  who are eligible for pediatric 
essential dental benefits and who are enrolled under 
the same family membership)  
Your out -of-pocket maximum  is the most you could pay during the annual coverage period ( as shown 
above) for your sha re of the costs for covered services —your cost -sharing amounts. This out -of-pocket 
maximum helps you plan for health care expenses. Even though you pay the following costs, they do not 
count toward your out-of-pocket maximum : your premiums ; any balance -billed charges; all costs for 
dental services for members  who are not eligible for pediatric essential dental benefits ; and all services 
this dental plan does not  cover.

apply for specific covered services , such as for periodic oral exams. Some of these limits are described in 
this Schedule of Dental Benefits  in the chart that starts  below. Do not rely on this chart alone. Your 
dental policy along with this Schedule of Dental Benefits  fully describes all of the limits and exclusions 
that apply for your dental benefits. Be sure to read all parts of your dental policy.

WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 1 Introduction 
This Subscriber Certificate explains your health care coverage and the terms of your enrollment in this Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  health plan. It describes your responsibilities to receive health care coverage 
and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  responsibilities to you. This Subscriber Certificate also has a 
Schedule of Benefits for your specific plan option. This schedule describes the cost share amounts that you 
must pay for covered services  (such as a deductible  or a copayment ). You should read all parts of this 
Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  to become familiar with the key points. You should 
keep them handy so that you can refer to them. The words that are shown in italics have special meanings. 
These words are explained in Part 2 of this Subscriber Certificate. 
When you enroll for coverage in this Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  health plan, you may enroll as a 
group member  under a group contract . Or, you may enroll directly under an individual contract . The 
contract for coverage in this health plan is a prepaid (“insured”) health maintenance contract. Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  certifies that you have the right to this health care coverage as long as: you are 
enrolled in this health plan when you receive covered services ; the premium that is owed for your health 
plan has been paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ; and you follow all of the requirements to receive 
this health care coverage. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is located at: 101 Huntington Avenue, 
Suite 1300, Boston, Massachusetts 02199-7611. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and/or your group (when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group 
member) may change the health care coverage described in this Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule 
of Benefits . If this is the case, the change is described in a rider. Please keep any riders with your Subscriber 
Certificate and Schedule of Benefits  so that you can refer to them. 
As a member of this Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  health plan, you will be asked to choose (or 
designate) a primary care provider  who participates in your health care network. Your primary care 
provider will furnish most of your health care and, when it is needed, will arrange for or coordinate your 
other covered services . Except for emergency medical care , you have also agreed that you will receive all 
of your health care from providers who participate in your health care network. This health plan will not 
cover services or supplies that you receive from a health care provider who does not participate in your 
health care network. The only exceptions are described in this Subscriber Certificate in Part 8. 
Before using your health care coverage, you should make note of the limits and exclusions. These limits 
and exclusions are described in this Subscriber Certificate in Parts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
The term “you” refers to any member who has the right to the coverage provided by this health plan—the 
subscriber  or the enrolled spouse or any other enrolled dependent. 
  
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 2 Part 1  
Member Services 
Your Primary Care Provider 
At the time you enroll in this Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  health plan, you will be required to choose 
(or designate) a primary care provider who participates in your health care network. You have the right to 
choose (or designate) any primary care provider  who participates in your health care network and who is 
available to accept you or your family members. The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option will tell 
you the name of your health care network. The provider directory that is provided for your specific plan 
option lists all of the primary care providers  who participate in your health care network. You can choose 
a primary care provider  who is an internist, a family practitioner, a pediatrician, a nurse practitioner, or a 
physician assistant. Your primary care provider  will furnish most of your health care and, when it is needed, 
will arrange for or coordinate other covered services . (Your primary care provider  is often referred to as 
your “PCP.”) Usually, different members of a family have different health care needs. For this reason, each 
member of a family may choose a different primary care provider . Your choice is important. Your choice 
will determine who you will see for most of your health care and where you will receive it. This is because 
a primary care provider  will most often send their patients to network specialists who are affiliated with 
the primary care provider’s  network hospital or medical group. Your choice is also important because it 
may impact the costs that you pay for some health care services.  As soon as you enroll and you choose 
your primary care provider , you should make an appointment with your primary care provider . This will 
allow your primary care provider  to get to know your medical history and to give you medical attention 
and treatment that is tailored to your needs. 
When You Need Help to Choose a Primary Care Provider 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  can help you choose your primary care provider . If you need help, call 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The toll free phone number to call is shown 
on your ID card. You can also call the toll free phone number that is shown in the HMO Blue provider 
directory that applies for your specific plan option. Or, you can call the Find a Doctor support line at 
1-800-821-1388 . 
When You Want to Change Your Primary Care Provider 
You may change your primary care provider . All you have to do is call or write to the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. Or, you can make this change online by using the Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  member self service option. To change your primary care provider  online, log on 
to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at www.bluecrossma.org . Just follow the steps to change 
your “PCP.” 
When Your Primary Care Provider Disenrolls from the Network 
If your primary care provider  disenrolls from the health care network,  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
will send you a written notice at least 30 days before your primary care provider’s  disenrollment date. The 
notice will tell you how to choose a new primary care provider . In most cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will continue to provide coverage for covered services  you receive from your primary care 
provider for up to 30 days past the primary care provider’s  disenrollment date. (If you do not choose a new 
primary care provider  within 30 days, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may choose one for you. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know if a new primary care provider  is chosen for you.) Part 1 – Member Services  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 3 Your Health Care Network 
To receive all of your health plan coverage, you must obtain your health care services and supplies from 
providers who participate in the health care network for your specific plan option. The Schedule of Benefits  
for your plan option will tell you the name of your health care network. The provider directory that is 
provided for your specific plan option lists the health care providers who participate in your health care 
network. The health care providers that participate in your health care network are referred to as “ covered 
providers ” or “network providers .” If you need emergency medical care , this health plan will cover those 
services even when they are furnished by a health care provider who is not a network provider. See Part 8 
in this Subscriber Certificate for a few other times when this health plan may cover services or supplies that 
you receive from a provider who does not participate in your health care network. Except as described in 
this Subscriber Certificate, this health plan will not cover any services or supplies that you receive from 
providers who do not participate in the health care network for your specific plan option. 
When You Need Help to Find a Health Care Provider 
There are a few ways for you to find a health care provider who participates in your health care network. 
At the time you enroll in this health plan, a directory of health care providers for your specific plan option 
will be made available to you at no additional cost. To find out if a health care provider participates in your 
health care network, you can look in this provider directory. Or, you can also use any one of the following 
ways to find a provider who participates in your health care network. You can:

help, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. They will help you find

Your Rights under Mental Health Parity Laws 
This health plan provides coverage for medically necessary  mental health and substance use treatment 
according to federal and state mental health parity laws. The financial requirements and treatment limits for 
your mental health or substance use coverage can be no more restrictive than those for your medical and 
surgical coverage. This means that the cost share amounts (a copayment , coinsurance , or deductible ) for 
services to treat mental health and substance use will be the same or less than those for comparable medical 
and surgical services. Also, the review and authorization of services to treat mental health or substance use 
will be handled in a way that is comparable to the review and authorization of medical and surgical services. 
If Blue Cross Blue Shield  HMO Blue  makes a decision to deny or reduce authorization of a service, you 
will receive a letter that explains the reason for the denial or reduction. Blue Cross Blue Shield  HMO Blue  
will send you or your health care provider a copy of the criteria used to make this decision, at your request. 
You should be sure to read all parts of your Subscriber Certificate to understand your health plan coverage.

you can make a complaint to the Massachusetts Division of Insurance (the Division) Consumer Services 
Section. A complaint can be made by phone or in writing. To send a written complaint, you must use the 
Division’s “Insurance Complaint Form.” You can request a copy of this form from the Division by phone 
or by mail. You can also find this form on the Division’s Web site at

When you make a complaint, you must include: your name and address; the nature of your complaint; and 
your signature authorizing the release of any information about the complaint to help the Division with its 
review. 
In addition to filing a written complaint with the Division, you must file an appeal with Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  to have your denial or reduction in coverage reviewed. This may be necessary to protect 
your right to continued coverage while you wait for an appeal decision. To file an appeal with Blue Cross 
Blue Shield  HMO Blue , you must follow the formal review procedures outlined in Part 10. 
Note: As required by the Affordable Care Act, the catastrophic health plan HMO Blue Essential exempts

 Page 9 Part 2  
Explanation of Terms 
The following words are shown in italics in this Subscriber Certificate, your Schedule of Benefits , and any 
riders that apply to your coverage in this health plan. The meaning of these words will help you understand 
your benefits. 
Allowed Charge (Allowed Amount) 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  calculates payment of your benefits based on the allowed charge 
(sometimes referred to as the  allowed amount ). This is the maximum amount on which payment is based 
for covered health care services. This may be called “eligible expense,” “payment allowance,” or 
“negotiated rate.” The allowed charge  that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses depends on the type of 
health care provider that furnishes the covered service  to you. 
 For Network Providers.  For health care providers who have an HMO Blue payment agreement with 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc., the allowed charge  is based on the 
provisions of that health care provider’s network payment agreement for your specific plan option. 
(When you are enrolled in a New England plan option, this also applies for health care providers who 
have a network payment agreement with one of the New England Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
Plans with which Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. has arranged for the 
Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan to provide access to covered services  to members.) For covered 
services furnished by these health care providers, you pay only your deductible  and/or your 
copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. In general, when you share in the cost for 
your covered services  (such as a deductible , and/or a copayment , and/or a coinsurance ), the 
calculation for the amount that you pay is based on the initial full allowed charge  for that health care 
provider (or the actual charge if it is less). This amount that you pay for a covered service  is generally 
not subject to future adjustments—up or down—even though the health care provider’s payment may 
be subject to future adjustments for such things as provider contractual settlements, risk-sharing 
settlements, and fraud or other operations. 
A network provider’s  payment agreement may provide for an allowed charge  that is more than the 
provider’s actual charge. For example, a hospital’s allowed charge  for an inpatient admission may be 
based on a “Diagnosis Related Grouping” (DRG). In this case, the allowed charge  may be more than 
the hospital’s actual charge. If this is the case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will calculate your 
cost share amount based on the lesser amount—this means the network provider’s  actual charge 
instead of the allowed charge  will be used to calculate your cost share. The claim payment made to 
the network provider  will be the full amount of the allowed charge  less your cost share amount. 
When you are enrolled in a limited provider network plan, these allowed charge  provisions also apply 
for a health care provider who has an HMO Blue payment agreement but who is not in the limited 
provider network for your specific plan option. There is one exception. For a health care provider 
who declined to participate in the limited provider network, see the “For Other Health Care 
Providers” paragraph on the next page.  
 For Health Care Providers Outside of Massachusetts with a Local Payment Agreement.  For 
non-network health care providers outside of Massachusetts who have a payment agreement with the Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 10 local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan, the allowed charge  is the “negotiated price” that the local 
Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan passes on to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (Blue Cross 
and/or Blue Shield Plan means an independent corporation or affiliate operating under a license from 
the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.) In many cases, the negotiated price paid by Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  to the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan is a discount from the 
provider’s billed charges. However, a number of local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans can 
determine only an estimated price at the time your claim is paid. Any such estimated price is based on 
expected settlements, withholds, any other contingent payment arrangements and non-claims 
transactions, such as interest on provider advances, with the provider (or with a specific group of 
providers) of the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in the area where services are received. In 
addition, some local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans’ payment agreements with providers do not 
give a comparable discount for all claims. These local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans elect to 
smooth out the effect of their payment agreements with providers by applying an average discount to 
claims. The price that reflects average savings may result in greater variation (more or less) from the 
actual price paid than will the estimated price. Local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans that use 
these estimated or averaging methods to calculate the negotiated price may prospectively adjust their 
estimated or average prices to correct for overestimating or underestimating past prices. However, the 
amount you pay is considered a final price. In most cases for covered services  furnished by these 
health care providers, you pay only your deductible  and/or your copayment  and/or your 
coinsurance , whichever applies.  
 For Other Health Care Providers.  For covered health care providers who do not have a payment 
agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  (and for covered health care providers outside of 
Massachusetts who do not have a payment agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
Plan), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will use the methods outlined below to calculate your claim 
payment. 
Patient Protections Against Surprise Billing  
Under federal law, you are protected from “balance billing” or “surprise billing” (an unexpected 
balance bill) in certain situations. Under the law, you cannot be balance billed for certain covered 
services that you may receive. But, for these covered services , you will continue to be responsible for 
any copayment , deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies. 
You cannot be balance billed when you receive: 
 Emergency services.  This includes: emergency services you receive at an emergency room of a 
hospital or an independent free-standing emergency facility; and certain covered services  that 
may be required to stabilize you (post-stabilization services) until such time that your attending 
physician determines you meet certain criteria as outlined under federal law. When you become 
stabilized and any notice and consent requirements as specified in the statute are met, surprise 
billing protection no longer applies. See “All Other Covered Services” below for how your claim 
payment will be calculated when this happens. 
 Non-emergency services furnished by a non- network provider  at certain network facilities. 
This includes services you receive at: a hospital; a hospital outpatient department; a critical access 
hospital; an ambulatory surgical center; or any other facility designated by the statute that 
provides items or services for which coverage is provided under this health plan unless the notice 
and consent requirements as specified in the statute have been met. A provider or facility cannot 
provide notice and receive consent for certain ancillary services, as defined by the No Surprises 
Act, including items or services related to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 11 radiology and neonatology. This also includes services provided by assistant surgeons and 
diagnostic services. 
 Air ambulance services by a non-network air ambulance provider.  
For the covered services  described above, the “recognized amount” will be used to calculate your cost 
share amount ( deductible and/or copaymen t and/or coinsurance ). The recognized amount is defined 
by federal law as: an amount determined by an applicable All-Payer Model Agreement under 
Section 1115A of the Social Security Act; or, if there is no applicable All-Payer Model Agreement, 
an amount determined by a specified state law where the services were furnished; or, if there is no 
applicable All-Payer Model Agreement or specified state law, the lesser of the amount billed by the 
provider or facility or the Qualified Payment Amount (QPA), which under the final rules generally is 
the median of the contracted rates of the plan or issuer for the item or service in the geographic 
region. 
For covered services  furnished in Massachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses the QPA as 
the recognized amount to calculate your claim payment. For covered services  furnished in a state 
other than Massachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses the applicable recognized amount 
that is provided by the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan for that state to calculate your claim 
payment. (If a non- network provider  is dissatisfied with a payment made by the health plan, the 
provider can initiate a structured process to resolve the dispute. Federal law protects you from any 
payment disputes that may arise between plans and providers.) Note: The QPA will be used as the 
recognized amount to calculate your claim payment for covered air ambulance transport that is 
furnished by a non- network provider  in or outside of Massachusetts. 
All Other Covered Services 
For all other covered services not described above that are not protected from surprise billing by the 
No Surprises Act, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses the health care provider’s actual charge to 
calculate your claim payment. For covered services  furnished by these health care providers, you 
pay only your deductible  and/or your copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. 
Any cost share amounts that you pay for these covered services will count toward your deductible (if 
applicable) and your  out-of-pocket maximum . 
Exception: For health care providers who do not have a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  or, for health care providers outside of Massachusetts, with the local Blue Cross 
and/or Blue Shield Plan, there may be times when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue is able to 
negotiate a fee with the provider that is less than the allowed charge  that would have been used to 
calculate your claim payment (as described in the above paragraph). When this happens, the 
“negotiated fee” will be used as the allowed charge  to calculate your claim payment and you will not 
have to pay the amount of the provider’s charge that is in excess of the negotiated fee. You will only 
have to pay your deductible  and/or your  copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send you a written notice about your claim that will tell you how 
your claim was calculated, including the allowed charge , the amount paid to the provider, and the 
amount you must pay to the provider. 
Exception for members enrolled in a limited provider network plan: For a covered health care 
provider who has an HMO Blue payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , but who 
has declined to participate in the limited provider network for your specific plan option, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses the health care provider’s actual charge, or a lower charge that has been 
negotiated with the health care provider, to calculate your claim payment. For covered services  Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 12 furnished by these health care providers, you pay only your deductible  and/or your copayment  
and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. 
Pharmacy Providers 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may have payment arrangements with pharmacy providers that may 
result in rebates on covered drugs and supplies. The cost that you pay for a covered drug or supply is 
determined at the time you buy the drug or supply. The cost that you pay will not be adjusted for any later 
rebates, settlements, or other monies paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  from pharmacy providers 
or vendors. 
Appeal 
An appeal is something you do if you disagree with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decision to deny 
a request for coverage of health care services or drugs, or payment, in part or in full, for services or drugs 
you already received. You may also make an appeal if you disagree with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue decision to stop coverage for services that you are receiving. For example, you may ask for an appeal 
if Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  doesn’t pay for a service, item, or drug that you think you should be 
able to receive. Part 10 explains what you have to do to make an appeal. It also explains the review process. 
Benefit Limit 
For certain health care services or supplies, there may be day, visit, or dollar benefit maximums that apply 
to your coverage in this health plan. The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option and Part 5 of this 
Subscriber Certificate describe the benefit limits  that apply to your coverage. (Also refer to riders—if there 
are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) Once the amount of the benefits that you have 
received reaches the benefit limit  for a specific covered service , no more benefits will be provided by this 
health plan for those health care services or supplies. When this happens, you must pay the full amount of 
the provider’s charges that you incur for those health care services or supplies that are more than the benefit 
limit. An overall lifetime benefit limit  will not apply for coverage in this health plan. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. is the not-for-profit managed care subsidiary 
of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is licensed by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a health maintenance organization (HMO) to arrange for the 
coordinated delivery of health care services to its members. The term “Plan” is often used to refer to Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. “Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ” and “Plan” 
also means an employee or designee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. 
(including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. or another Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
Plan) who is authorized to make decisions or take action called for by this health plan. This also means, for 
example, that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  policies, programs, documents, tools, and administrative 
areas may mean the policies, programs, documents, tools, and administrative areas of Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. or another designee. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has full discretionary 
authority to interpret this Subscriber Certificate. This includes determining the amount, form, and timing 
of benefits, conducting medical necessity reviews, and resolving any other matters regarding your right to 
benefits for covered services  as described in this Subscriber Certificate. All determinations by Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue with respect to benefits under this health plan will be conclusive and binding unless 
it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious. 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. is the parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. ( Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ). Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued)

 Page 13 Massachusetts, Inc. has entered into a management contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to 
provide administrative services. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. will not be responsible 
for or have any contractual obligations with respect to this health plan. “Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts, Inc.” also means an employee or designee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, 
Inc. who is authorized to make decisions or take action called for by this health plan. 
Coinsurance 
For some covered services , you may have to pay a coinsurance . This means the cost that you pay for these 
covered services (your “cost share amount”) will be calculated as a percentage. When a coinsurance does 
apply to a specific covered service , Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will calculate your cost share amount 
based on the health care provider’s actual charge or the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge , 
whichever is less (unless otherwise required by law). The Schedule of Benefits for your plan option shows 
the covered services for which you must pay a coinsurance (if there are any). If a coinsurance  does apply, 
your Schedule of Benefits  also shows the percentage that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will use to 
calculate your cost share amount. (Also refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to your coverage in 
this health plan.) 
Copayment 
For some covered services , you may have to pay a copayment . This means the cost that you pay for these 
covered services  (your “cost share amount”) is a fixed dollar amount. In most cases, a covered provider  
will collect the copayment  from you at the time they furnish the covered service . However, when the health 
care provider’s actual charge at the time of providing the covered service  is less than your copayment , you 
pay only that health care provider’s actual charge or the  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue allowed charge , 
whichever is less (unless otherwise required by law). Any later charge adjustment—up or down—will not 
affect your copayment  (or the cost you were charged at the time of the service if it was less than the 
copayment ). The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option show the amount of your copayment . It also 
shows those covered services  for which you must pay a copayment . (Also refer to riders—if there are any—
that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) 
Covered Providers (Network Providers) 
To receive your health plan coverage, all of your health care services and supplies must be furnished by 
health care providers who participate in the health care network for your specific plan option. (The only 
exceptions are described in Part 8 of this Subscriber Certificate.) The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan 
option will tell you the name of your health care network.  The provider directory that is provided for 
your specific plan option lists the health care providers that participate in your health care network. These 
covered health care providers are referred to as “ covered providers ” or “network providers. ” A covered 
provider (or network provider ) is a health care provider who has a written HMO Blue payment agreement 
with, or that has been designated by, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. to 
provide access to covered services  to members enrolled in your specific plan option. (Or, when you are 
enrolled in a New England plan option, the health care provider has a network payment agreement with one 
of the New England Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans to furnish covered services  to members.) To find 
out if a health care provider participates in your health care network, you can look in the provider directory 
that is provided for your specific plan option. 
The kinds of health care providers that are covered providers  are those that are listed below in this section. 
 Hospital and Other Covered Facilities. These kinds of health care providers are: alcohol and drug 
treatment facilities; ambulatory surgical facilities; chronic disease hospitals (sometimes referred to as Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 14 a chronic care or long term care hospital for medically necessary  covered services ); community health 
centers; day care centers; detoxification facilities; free-standing diagnostic imaging facilities; 
free-standing dialysis facilities; free-standing radiation therapy and chemotherapy facilities; general 
hospitals; independent labs; licensed outpatient birthing centers;  limited services clinics; mental 
health centers; mental hospitals; opioid treatment program providers; rehabilitation hospitals; and 
skilled nursing facilities. 
 Physician and Other Covered Professional Providers. These kinds of health care providers are: 
certified registered nurse anesthetists; chiropractors; clinical specialists in psychiatric and mental 
health nursing; dentists; licensed acupuncturists; licensed alcohol and drug counselor I providers; 
licensed applied behavioral analysts; licensed audiologists; licensed dietitian nutritionists (or a 
dietitian or a nutritionist or a dietitian nutritionist who is licensed or certified by the state in which the 
provider practices); licensed hearing instrument specialists; licensed independent clinical social 
workers; licensed marriage and family therapists; licensed mental health counselors; licensed 
speech-language pathologists; nurse midwives; nurse practitioners; occupational therapists; 
optometrists; physical therapists; physicians; physician assistants; podiatrists; psychiatric nurse 
practitioners; psychologists; and urgent care centers. 
 Other Covered Health Care Providers. These kinds of health care providers are: ambulance 
services; appliance companies; cardiac rehabilitation centers; early intervention providers; home 
health agencies; home infusion therapy providers; hospice providers; mail order pharmacy; oxygen 
suppliers; retail pharmacies; and visiting nurse associations. 
A covered provider  may include other health care providers that are designated for you by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue . 
Covered Services 
This Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  describe the health care services and supplies for 
which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will provide coverage for you while you are enrolled in this health 
plan. (Also refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) These health 
care services and supplies are referred to as “ covered services .” Except as described otherwise in this 
Subscriber Certificate, all covered services  must be medically necessary  for you, furnished by health care 
providers who participate in the health care network for your specific plan option and, when it is required, 
arranged for or coordinated by your primary care provider  or approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue. (See Part 8 in this Subscriber Certificate for the few times when this health plan may cover services 
and supplies that you receive from a health care provider who does not participate in your health care 
network.) 
Custodial Care 
Custodial care is a type of care that is not covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Custodial care  
means any of the following : 
 Care that is given primarily by medically-trained personnel for a member who shows no significant 
improvement response despite extended or repeated treatment; or 
 Care that is given for a condition that is not likely to improve, even if the member receives attention 
of medically-trained personnel; or 
 Care that is given for the maintenance and monitoring of an established treatment program, when no 
other aspects of treatment require an acute level of care; or Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 15  Care that is given for the purpose of meeting personal needs which could be provided by persons 
without medical training, such as assistance with mobility, dressing, bathing, eating and preparation 
of special diets, and taking medications. 
Custodial care does not include the habilitation services that are described as a covered service  in Part 5. 
Deductible 
For some covered services , you may have to pay a deductible before you will receive benefits from this 
health plan. When your plan option includes a deductible , the amount that is put toward your deductible  is 
generally calculated based on the health care provider’s actual charge or the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue allowed charge , whichever is less (unless otherwise required by law). As required by federal law for 
“surprise billing,” any deductible  that applies for certain covered services that are furnished by non- network 
providers will be calculated based on the recognized amount and will contribute toward satisfying your 
deductible  (see Part 2, “Allowed Charge” for an explanation of these services). Your ID card and the 
Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option show the amount of your deductible  (if there is one). Your 
Schedule of Benefits  also shows those covered services  for which you must pay the deductible  before you 
receive benefits. (Also refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) 
When a deductible  does apply, there are some costs that you pay that do not count toward the deductible . 
These costs that do not count toward the deductible  are: 
 Any copayments  and/or coinsurance  you pay. 
 The costs you pay when your coverage is reduced or denied because you did not follow the 
requirements of the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  utilization review  program. (See Part 4.) 
 The costs you pay that are more than the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge . 
 The costs you pay because your health plan has provided all of the benefits it allows for that covered 
service. 
(There may be certain times when amounts that you have paid toward a deductible under a prior health plan 
or contract may be counted toward satisfying your deductible  under this health plan. To see if this applies 
to you, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office.) 
The deductible  is indexed to the average national premium growth and the amount may be increased 
annually. This means that your  deductible  amount may increase from time to time, as determined by Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you if this happens. However, 
the amount of your deductible  will never be more than the maximum deductible  amount allowed under 
applicable law. 
Diagnostic Lab Tests 
This health plan provides coverage for diagnostic lab tests . These covered services  include tests which 
analyze samples from the body such as blood, waste, or tissue. These tests include (but are not limited to): 
12-lead electrocardiograms; standard electroencephalograms; and glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1C) 
tests, urinary protein/microalbumin tests, and lipid profiles to diagnose and treat diabetes. 
Diagnostic X-Ray and Other Imaging Tests 
This health plan provides coverage for diagnostic x-ray and other imaging tests . These tests provide an 
internal image of the body and are recorded as permanent pictures, such as film. These tests can be low-tech 
radiology services, such as ultrasounds, x-rays, and fluoroscopic tests. Or, they can be high-tech radiology 
services, such as computerized axial tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 16 emission tomography (PET scans), and nuclear cardiac imaging. Imaging tests may pair pictures of the 
body with functional measurements, such as a barium swallow test. 
Effective Date 
This term is used to mean the date, as shown on Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  records, on which 
your coverage in this health plan starts. Or, it means the date on which a change to your coverage in this 
health plan takes effect. 
Emergency Medical Care 
As a member of this health plan, you have worldwide coverage for emergency medical care . This is the 
type of care you need immediately due to the sudden onset of an emergency medical condition. An 
“emergency medical condition” is a medical condition, whether physical, behavioral, related to substance 
use, or mental, manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that, in 
the absence of prompt care, could reasonably be expected by a prudent layperson who has an average 
knowledge of health and medicine to result in: 
 placing your life or health or the health of another (including an unborn child) in serious jeopardy; or 
 serious impairment of bodily functions; or 
 serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or, 
 as determined by a provider with knowledge of your condition, severe pain that cannot be managed 
without such care. 
Some examples of conditions that require emergency medical care  are: suspected heart attacks; strokes; 
poisoning; loss of consciousness; convulsions; and suicide attempts. This also includes treatment of mental 
conditions  when: you are admitted as an inpatient as required under Massachusetts General Laws, 
Chapter 123, Section 12; you seem very likely to endanger yourself as shown by a serious suicide attempt, 
a plan to commit suicide, or behavior that shows that you are not able to care for yourself; or you seem very 
likely to endanger others as shown by an action against another person that could cause serious physical 
injury or death or by a plan to harm another person. 
For purposes of filing a claim or the formal appeal and grievance  review (see Parts 9 and 10 of this 
Subscriber Certificate), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  considers “ emergency medical care ” to 
constitute “urgent care” as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as 
amended (ERISA). 
Grievance 
A grievance  is a type of oral or written complaint you make about care or service you received from Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from a provider who participates in your health care network. This type of 
complaint concerns the service you receive or the quality of your care. It does not involve a dispute with a 
coverage or payment decision. Part 10 explains what you have to do to file a grievance . It also explains the 
review process. 
Group 
When you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , the group is your agent and is not the agent 
of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The term “ group” refers to the corporation, partnership, individual 
proprietorship, or other organization that has an agreement for Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide 
its enrolled group members  with access to health care services and benefits. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 17 Group Contract 
When you enroll in this health plan as a group member, you are enrolled under a group contract. If this 
applies to your coverage in this health plan, your group eligibility, termination, and continuation of 
coverage provisions are described in Part 11 of this Subscriber Certificate. Under a group contract, the 
subscriber’s  group has an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide the subscriber  and 
their enrolled dependents with access to health care services and benefits. The group will make payments 
to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for coverage in this health plan for its enrolled group members. The 
group should also deliver to its group members all notices from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The 
group is the subscriber’s  agent and is not the agent of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . A group contract 
includes: this Subscriber Certificate; the Schedule of Benefits for your plan option; any riders or other 
changes to the group contract; the subscriber’s  enrollment form; and the agreement that Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  has with the subscriber’s group  to provide coverage for the subscriber  and their enrolled 
dependents. This Subscriber Certificate is not a contract between you and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue. The group contract will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts, except as preempted by federal law. 
You hereby expressly acknowledge your understanding that the group contract constitutes a contract solely 
between your group on your behalf and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. 
(Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ), which is a corporation independent of and operating under a license 
from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an association of independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Plans (the “Association”), permitting Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to use the Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield Service Marks in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
is not contracting as the agent of the Association. You further acknowledge and agree that your group on 
your behalf has not entered into the group contract based upon representations by any person other than 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and that no person, entity, or organization other than Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will be held accountable or liable to you or your group on your behalf for any of Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  obligations to you created under the group contract. This paragraph will 
not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the part of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  other 
than those obligations created under other provisions of the group contract. 
Individual Contract 
When you enroll in this health plan directly as an individual, you are enrolled for coverage under an 
individual contract . (This means that you did not enroll for coverage in this health plan as a group member .) 
If this applies to your coverage in this health plan, your eligibility and termination provisions are described 
in Part 12 of this Subscriber Certificate. Under an individual contract , the subscriber  has an agreement 
directly with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide the subscriber  and their enrolled dependents 
with access to health care services and benefits. The subscriber  will make payments to Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  for coverage in this health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send notices to 
the subscriber . An individual contract  includes: this Subscriber Certificate; the Schedule of Benefits for 
your plan option; any riders or other changes to the individual  contract; and the subscriber’s  enrollment 
form. The individual  contract will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, except as preempted by federal law. 
Important Note:  If you enroll in this health plan as an individual  member through the Massachusetts Health 
Connector, the subscriber  has an agreement with the Health Connector. The subscriber  will usually make 
payments to the Health Connector for coverage in this health plan. The Health Connector will send all 
notices to the subscriber . Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued)

 Page 18 You hereby expressly acknowledge your understanding that an individual  contract constitutes a contract 
solely between you and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. ( Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue ), which is a corporation independent of and operating under a license from the Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield Association, an association of independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans (the 
“Association”), permitting Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service 
Marks in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not 
contracting as the agent of the Association. You further acknowledge and agree that you have not entered 
into an individual  contract based upon representations by any person other than Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  and that no person, entity, or organization other than Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will be 
held accountable or liable to you for any of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  obligations to you created 
under an individual  contract. This paragraph will not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the 
part of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  other than those obligations created under other provisions of the 
individual  contract. 
Inpatient 
The term “inpatient” refers to your status as a hospital patient, or as a patient in a health care facility, when 
you are admitted as a registered bed patient. Even if you stay in the hospital or health care facility overnight, 
you might still be considered an “outpatient.” Your status is important because it affects how much you 
will pay for covered services , like x-rays, drugs, lab tests, and physician services. You are an inpatient 
starting the day you are formally admitted with a doctor’s order as a registered bed patient in a hospital or 
other health care facility. Note: You are an outpatient  when you are kept in a hospital or health care facility 
solely for observation, even though you use a bed or spend the night. Observation services are to help the 
doctor decide if a patient needs to be admitted for care or can be discharged. These services may be given 
in the emergency room or another area of the hospital. If you would normally pay a copayment  for 
outpatient  emergency medical care  or outpatient  medical care services, the copayment  will be waived when 
you are held for observation. But, you must still pay your deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies. 
Medical Policy 
To receive your health plan coverage, your health care services and supplies must meet the criteria for 
coverage that are defined in each Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue medical policy  that applies. Each health 
care service or supply must also meet the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical technology assessment 
criteria. (See below.) The policies and criteria that will apply are those that are in effect at the time you 
receive the health care service or supply. These policies are based upon Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  
assessment of the quality of the scientific and clinical evidence that is published in peer reviewed journals. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also consider other clinical sources that are generally accepted and 
credible. (These sources may include specialty society guidelines, textbooks, and expert opinion.) These 
medical policies  explain Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  criteria for when a health care service or 
supply is medically necessary , or is not medically necessary , or is investigational. These policies form the 
basis of coverage decisions. A policy may not exist for each health care service or supply. If this is the case 
for a certain health care service or supply, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may apply its medical 
technology assessment criteria  and its medical necessity  criteria to determine if the health care service or 
supply is medically necessary  or if it is not medically necessary  or if it is investigational. To check for a 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical policy , you can go online and log on to the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  Web site at www.bluecrossma.org . (Your health care provider can also access a policy 
by using the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  provider Web site.) Or, you can call the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. You can ask them to mail a copy to you. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 19 Medical Technology Assessment Criteria 
To receive your health plan coverage, all of your health care services and supplies must conform to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical technology assessment criteria . These criteria assess whether a 
technology improves health outcomes such as length of life or ability to function when performing everyday 
tasks. The medical technology assessment criteria  that apply are those that are in effect at the time you 
receive a health care service or supply. These criteria are: 
 The technology must have final approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies. This 
criterion applies to drugs, biological products, devices (such as durable medical equipment), and 
diagnostic services. A drug, biological product, or device must have final approval from the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Any approval granted as an interim step in the FDA regulatory 
process is not sufficient. (The FDA Humanitarian Device Exemption is one example of an interim 
step.) Except as required by law, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may limit coverage for drugs, 
biological products, and devices to those specific indications, conditions, and methods of use 
approved by the FDA. 
 The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning the effect of the technology on health 
outcomes. The evidence should consist of well-designed and well-conducted investigations published 
in peer-reviewed English-language journals. The qualities of the body of studies and the consistency 
of the results are considered in evaluating the evidence. The evidence should demonstrate that the 
technology can measurably alter the physiological changes related to a disease, injury, illness, or 
condition. In addition, there should be evidence or a convincing argument based on established 
medical facts that the measured alterations affect health outcomes. Opinions and evaluations by 
national medical associations, consensus panels, and other technology evaluation bodies are evaluated 
according to the scientific quality of the supporting evidence upon which they are based. 
 The technology must improve the net health outcome. The technology’s beneficial effects on health 
outcomes should outweigh any harmful effects on health outcomes. 
 The technology must be as beneficial as any established alternatives. The technology should improve 
the net outcome as much as or more than established alternatives. The technology must be as cost 
effective as any established alternative that achieves a similar health outcome. 
 The improvement must be attainable outside the investigational setting. When used under the usual 
conditions of medical practice, the technology should be reasonably expected to improve health 
outcomes to a degree comparable to that published in the medical literature. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also, as part of a “pilot” program, cover new technologies that are 
not otherwise described as a covered service . In these cases, the technologies that are covered under the 
pilot program must: be approved by the FDA; have published clinical literature showing safety and efficacy; 
and be reasonably expected to improve health outcomes. 
Medically Necessary (Medical Necessity) 
To receive your health plan coverage, all of your health care services and supplies must be medically 
necessary  and appropriate for your health care needs. (The only exceptions are for certain routine and 
preventive health care services that are covered by this health plan.) Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue has 
the discretion to determine which health care services and supplies that you receive (or you are planning to 
receive) are medically necessary  and appropriate for coverage. It will do this by referring to the guidelines 
described below. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 20 All health care services must be required services that a health care provider, using prudent clinical 
judgment, would provide to a patient in order to prevent or to evaluate or to diagnose or to treat an illness, 
injury, disease, or its symptoms. And, these health care services must also be: 
 Furnished in accordance with generally accepted standards of professional medical practice (as 
recognized by the relevant medical community); 
 Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; and they must be 
considered effective for your illness, injury, or disease; 
 Consistent with the diagnosis and treatment of your condition and in accordance with Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue medical policies and medical technology assessment criteria ; 
 Essential to improve your net health outcome and as beneficial as any established alternatives that are 
covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ; 
 Consistent with the level of skilled services that are furnished and furnished in the least intensive type 
of medical care setting that is required by your medical condition; and 
 Not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce the 
same therapeutic or diagnostic results to diagnose or treat your illness, injury, or disease. 
This does not include a service that: is primarily for your convenience or for the convenience of your family 
or the health care provider; is furnished solely for your religious preference; promotes athletic achievements 
or a desired lifestyle; improves your appearance or how you feel about your appearance; or increases or 
enhances your environmental or personal comfort. 
Member 
The term “you” refers to any member who has the right to the coverage provided by this health plan. A 
member may be the subscriber  or their enrolled eligible spouse (or former spouse, if applicable) or any 
other enrolled eligible dependent. 
Mental Conditions 
This health plan provides coverage for treatment of psychiatric illnesses or diseases. These include 
substance use disorders (such as drug and alcohol addiction). The illnesses or diseases that qualify as mental 
conditions  are listed in the latest edition, at the time you receive treatment, of the American Psychiatric 
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 
Mental Health Providers 
This health plan provides coverage for treatment of a mental condition when these covered services are 
furnished by a mental health provider  who participates in your health care network. These covered 
providers  include any one or more of the following kinds of health care providers: alcohol and drug 
treatment facilities; clinical specialists in psychiatric and mental health nursing; community health centers 
(that are a part of a general hospital); day care centers; detoxification facilities; general hospitals; licensed 
alcohol and drug counselor I providers; licensed independent clinical social workers; licensed marriage and 
family therapists; licensed mental health counselors; mental health centers; mental hospitals; opioid 
treatment program providers; physicians; psychiatric nurse practitioners; psychologists; and other mental 
health providers  that are designated for you by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Out-of-Pocket Limit) 
Under this health plan, there is a maximum cost share amount that you will have to pay for certain covered 
services. This is referred to as an “ out-of-pocket maximum .” Your ID card will show the amount of your 
out-of-pocket maximum.  The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option will show the amount of your Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 21 out-of-pocket maximum  and the time frame for which it applies—such as each calendar year or each plan 
year. It will also describe the cost share amounts you pay that will count toward the out-of-pocket maximum . 
(Also refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) Once the cost share 
amounts you have paid that count toward the out-of-pocket maximum  add up to the out-of-pocket maximum  
amount, you will receive full benefits based on the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge  for 
more of these covered services  during the rest of the time frame in which the  out-of-pocket maximum  
provision applies. There are some costs that you pay that do not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum . 
These costs that do not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum  are: 
 The premium you pay for your health plan. 
 The costs you pay when your coverage is reduced or denied because you did not follow the 
requirements of the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  utilization review program. (See Part 4.) 
 The costs you pay that are more than the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue allowed charge . 
 The costs you pay because your health plan has provided all of the benefits it allows for that covered 
service. 
Note: As required by federal law for “surprise billing,” any cost share amounts paid for certain covered 
services furnished by non- network providers  will contribute toward satisfying your out-of-pocket maximum  
amount. (See Part 2, “Allowed Charge” for an explanation of these services.)  
See the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option for other costs that you may have to pay that do not count 
toward your out-of-pocket maximum . 
The out-of-pocket maximum  is indexed to the average national premium growth and the amount may be 
increased annually. This means that your  out-of-pocket maximum  amount may increase from time to time, 
as determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you if 
this happens. However, the amount of your out-of-pocket maximum  will never be more than the maximum 
out-of-pocket maximum  amount allowed under applicable law. 
Outpatient 
The term “outpatient” refers to your status as a patient. Your status is important because it affects how 
much you will pay for covered services . You are an outpatient  if you are getting emergency room services, 
observation services, outpatient day surgery, or other hospital services such as lab tests or x-rays and the 
doctor has not written an order to admit you to the hospital or health care facility as an inpatient. In these 
cases, you are an outpatient  even if you spend the night at the hospital or health care facility. You are also 
an outpatient  if you are getting covered services  at a health center, at a provider’s office (this can be either 
in-person or via telehealth), or in other covered outpatient settings, or at home. You are also an outpatient  
if you are getting covered services  from a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue designated telehealth vendor. 
Note: You are an outpatient  when you are kept in a hospital or health care facility solely for observation, 
even though you use a bed or spend the night. Observation services are to help the doctor decide if a patient 
needs to be admitted for care or can be discharged. These services may be given in the emergency room or 
another area of the hospital. If you would normally pay a copayment  for outpatient  emergency medical care  
or outpatient  medical care services, the copayment  will be waived when you are held for observation. But, 
you must still pay your deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies. 
Plan Sponsor 
When you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , the plan sponsor  is usually your employer 
and is the same as the plan sponsor designated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended (ERISA). If you are a group member  and you are not sure who your plan sponsor  is, you 
should ask the subscriber’s  employer. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 22 Plan Year 
When your plan option includes a deductible  and/or an out-of-pocket maximum , these amounts will be 
calculated based on a calendar year or a plan year  basis. The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option will 
show whether a calendar year or a plan year  calculation applies to your coverage. (Also refer to riders—if 
there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) If a plan year  calculation applies, it means 
the period of time that starts on the original effective date  of your coverage in this health plan (or if you are 
enrolled in this health plan as a group member , your group’s coverage under the group contract) and 
continues for 12 consecutive months or until your renewal date, whichever comes first. A new plan year  
begins each 12-month period thereafter. If you do not know when your plan year  begins, you can ask Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Or, if you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , you can ask 
your plan sponsor . 
Premium 
For coverage in this health plan, the subscriber  (or the subscriber’s group  on your behalf when you are 
enrolled in this health plan as a group member) will pay a monthly premium to Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue . The total amount of your monthly premium is provided to you in the yearly evidence of 
coverage packet that is issued by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
will provide you with access to health care services and benefits as long as the total premium that is owed 
for your coverage in this health plan is paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  may change your premium. Each time Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  changes the premium 
for coverage in this health plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you (or the subscriber’s 
group when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member) before the change takes place. (If you 
enrolled in this health plan through the Massachusetts Health Connector, see Part 11 or Part 12, whichever 
applies to you, for information.) 
Primary Care Provider 
To receive coverage under this health plan, you will be required to choose (or designate) a primary care 
provider to furnish your primary medical care and to arrange for or coordinate other covered services . Your 
primary care provider  can be a network physician who is an internist, family practitioner, or pediatrician, 
or a network nurse practitioner, or a network physician assistant. You have the right to choose (or designate) 
any primary care provider  who participates in your health care network and who is available to accept you 
or your family members. The provider directory for your specific plan option lists the network primary care 
providers. See Part 1 for information on how to contact Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  if you need help 
to choose a primary care provider  or to find a listing of your health care network. The network primary 
care provider  who you chose (or designate) is often referred to as your “PCP.” Certain other network 
primary care providers have agreed to be “on call” for your primary care provider at times when they are 
not available. These are known as “covering primary care providers.” This health plan provides the same 
coverage for these covering primary care providers that it provides for your primary care provider . 
At any time, you may change your primary care provider  from a physician to a nurse practitioner or a 
physician assistant who is listed in your provider directory as a primary care provider. (See Part 1 in this 
Subscriber Certificate for help on how to change your primary care provider .) When you choose (or 
designate) a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant as your primary care provider , all of the same 
provisions that apply to a primary care provider  who is a physician will apply. 
Rider 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and/or your group (when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group 
member) may change the terms of your coverage in this health plan. If a material change is made to your Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 23 coverage in this health plan, it is described in a rider. For example, a rider may change the amount that you 
must pay for certain services such as the amount of your copayment . Or, it may add to or limit the benefits 
provided by this health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will supply you with riders (if there are 
any) that apply to your coverage in this health plan. You should keep these riders with this Subscriber 
Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  so that you can refer to them. 
Room and Board 
For an approved inpatient admission, covered services  include room and board . This means your room, 
meals, and general nursing services while you are an inpatient. This includes hospital services that are 
furnished in an intensive care or similar unit. 
Schedule of Benefits 
This Subscriber Certificate includes a Schedule of Benefits  for your specific plan option. It describes the 
cost share amount that you must pay for each covered service (such as a deductible , a copayment , or a 
coinsurance ). And, it includes important information about your deductible  and out-of-pocket maximum . It 
also describes benefit limits  that apply for certain covered services . Be sure to read all parts of this 
Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  to understand your health care benefits. You should 
read the Schedule of Benefits  along with the descriptions of covered services  and the limits and exclusions 
that are described in this Subscriber Certificate. 
A rider may change the information that is shown in your Schedule of Benefits . Be sure to read each rider 
(if there is any). 
Service Area 
The service area  is the geographic area in which you will receive all of your health care services and 
supplies. This means that no coverage will be provided for health care services or supplies that you receive 
outside of your service area , except as described in Part 3 of this Subscriber Certificate for: emergency 
medical care ; and urgent care . Your service area is described in the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan 
option. 
Special Services (Hospital and Facility Ancillary Services) 
When you receive health care services from a hospital or other covered health care facility, covered services  
include certain services and supplies that the health care facility normally furnishes to its patients for 
diagnosis or treatment while the patient is in the facility. These special services  include (but are not limited 
to) such things as: 
 The use of special rooms. These include: operating rooms; and treatment rooms. 
 Tests and exams. 
 The use of special equipment in the facility. Also, the services of the people hired by the facility to 
run the equipment. 
 Drugs, medications, solutions, biological preparations, and medical and surgical supplies that are used 
while you are in the facility. 
 Administration of infusions and transfusions and blood processing fees. These do not include the cost 
of: whole blood; packed red blood cells; blood donor fees; or blood storage fees. 
 Internal prostheses (artificial replacements of parts of the body) that are part of an operation. These 
include things such as: hip joints; skull plates; intraocular lenses that are implanted (or one pair of 
eyeglasses instead) after corneal transplant, cataract surgery, or other covered eye surgery, when the Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 24 natural eye lens is replaced; and pacemakers. They do not include things such as: ostomy bags; 
artificial limbs or eyes; hearing aids; or airplane splints. 
Subscriber 
The subscriber  is the eligible person who signs the enrollment form at the time of enrollment in this health 
plan. 
Urgent Care 
This health plan provides coverage for urgent care . This is medical, surgical, or psychiatric care, other than 
emergency medical care , that you need right away. This is care that you need to prevent serious 
deterioration of your health when an unforeseen illness or injury occurs. In most cases, urgent care will be 
brief diagnostic care and treatment to stabilize your condition. (For purposes of filing a claim or a formal 
appeal or grievance  review, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  considers “ emergency medical care ” to 
constitute “urgent care” as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as 
amended (ERISA). As used in this Subscriber Certificate, this urgent care term is not the same as the 
“urgent care” term defined under ERISA.) 
Utilization Review 
This term refers to the programs that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses to evaluate the necessity and 
appropriateness of your health care services and supplies. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses a set of 
formal techniques that are designed to monitor the use of, or evaluate the clinical necessity, appropriateness, 
efficacy or efficiency of health care services, procedures or settings, and drugs. These programs are 
designed to encourage appropriate care and services (not less care). Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
understands the need for concern about underutilization. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue shares this 
concern with its members and health care providers. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue does not compensate 
individuals who conduct utilization review activities based on denials. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
also does not offer incentives to health care providers to encourage inappropriate denials of care and 
services. These programs may include any or all of the following: 
 Pre-admission review, concurrent review, and discharge planning. 
 Pre-approval of some outpatient  services, including drugs (whether the drugs are furnished to you by 
a health care provider along with a covered service  or by a pharmacy). 
 Drug formulary management (compliance with the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue Drug 
Formulary). This also includes quality care dosing which helps to monitor the quantity and dose of 
the drug that you receive, based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations and 
clinical information. 
 Step therapy to help your health care provider furnish you with the appropriate drug treatment. (With 
step therapy, before coverage is approved for certain “second step” drugs, it is required that you first 
try an effective “first step” drug.) 
 Post-payment review. 
 Individual case management.

 Page 25 Part 3  
Emergency Services 
You do not need a referral from your health care provider or an approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue before you obtain emergency medical care . As a member of this health plan, you will receive 
worldwide emergency coverage. These emergency medical services may include inpatient or outpatient  
services by health care providers who are qualified to furnish emergency medical care . This includes care 
that is needed to evaluate or stabilize your emergency medical condition. At the onset of an emergency 
medical condition that in your judgment requires emergency medical care , you should go to the 
nearest emergency room. If you need help, dial 911. Or, call your local emergency medical service 
system phone number. You will not be denied coverage for medical and transportation services that you 
incur as a result of your emergency medical condition. You usually need emergency medical services 
because of the sudden onset of an emergency medical condition. An “emergency medical condition” is a 
medical condition, whether physical, behavioral, related to substance use, or mental, manifesting itself by 
acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that, in the absence of prompt care, could 
reasonably be expected by a prudent layperson who has an average knowledge of health and medicine to 
result in: placing your life or health or the health of another (including an unborn child) in serious jeopardy; 
or serious impairment of bodily functions; or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or, as 
determined by a provider with knowledge of your condition, severe pain that cannot be managed without 
such care. Some examples of conditions that require emergency medical care  are: suspected heart attacks; 
strokes; poisoning; loss of consciousness; convulsions; and suicide attempts. 
Inpatient Emergency Admissions 
Your condition may require that you be admitted into a hospital for  inpatient  emergency medical care.  If 
this happens, you or the admitting facility (or someone on your behalf) must call Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  within 48 hours of your admission. (A health care facility that participates in your health care 
network should call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for you.) This call must include: your name; your 
ID number; the name of the health care facility; the date of admission; and the condition for which you are 
receiving treatment. This information is required so that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  can evaluate 
and monitor the appropriateness of your inpatient health care services. 
Outpatient Emergency Services 
When you have an emergency medical condition, you should receive care at the nearest emergency room. 
If you receive emergency medical care  at an emergency room of a hospital that does not participate in your 
health care network, your health plan will provide the same coverage that you would otherwise receive if 
you had gone to a hospital that does participate in your health care network. 
When you are traveling outside of your service area, you may require emergency medical services or you 
may need urgent care . You usually need urgent care  because an unforeseen illness or injury occurs and 
based on your location, you are not able to obtain treatment from your primary care provider  or from a 
covered health care provider who participates in your health care network. Your health plan will cover 
urgent care  when you are temporarily outside of your service area . If you are traveling outside of your 
service area and you need urgent care , you should go to the nearest appropriate health care facility. Then, 
after you receive that urgent care , you must call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. You must make this call within 48 hours of receiving the urgent care . The Blue Cross Blue Shield Part 3 – Emergency Services  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 26 HMO Blue  toll free phone number to call is shown on your ID card. (Your health plan will cover one follow 
up visit outside of your service area  if you need it. This one follow up visit does not need prior approval 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as long as you are still outside of your service area  when you 
receive these services.) 
Post-Stabilization Care 
After your emergency medical condition has been evaluated and stabilized in the hospital emergency room, 
you may be ready to go home. Or, you may require further care. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
consider post-stabilization covered services  to be approved if an approval is not given within 30 minutes of 
the emergency room provider’s call. If the emergency room provider and your health care provider do not 
agree as to the right medical treatment for you, your health plan will cover the health care services and 
supplies that are recommended by the emergency room provider. But, benefits will be provided only for 
the health care services and supplies that are covered by your health plan. 
 Admissions from the Emergency Room. Your condition may require that you be admitted directly 
from the emergency room into that hospital for  inpatient  emergency medical care.  If this happens, 
you or the admitting facility (or someone on your behalf) must call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue. (A health care facility that participates in your health care network should call Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  for you.) This call must be made within 48 hours of your admission. This call must 
include: your name; your ID number; the name of the health care facility; the date of admission; and 
the condition for which you are receiving treatment. This is required so that Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  can evaluate and monitor the appropriateness of your inpatient health care services.  
 Transfers to Other Inpatient Facilities.  Your emergency room provider may recommend your 
transfer to another facility for inpatient care. If this happens, you or the admitting facility (or someone 
on your behalf) must call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (A health care facility that participates 
in your health care network should call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for you.) This call must be 
made within 48 hours of your admission. This is required so that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
can evaluate the appropriateness of the inpatient health care services. 
 Outpatient Follow Up Care.  Your emergency room provider may recommend that you have 
outpatient  follow up care. If this happens, the emergency room provider must call Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  to obtain an approval when the type of care that you need requires an approval 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (See Part 4.) If you need to have more follow up care and an 
approval is required, you or your health care provider must obtain the approval from Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue . (When you receive emergency medical care  outside of your service area , you will 
receive coverage for one follow up visit outside of your service area , if you need it. This one follow 
up visit does not need a referral from your primary care provider  or a pre-service approval from Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as long as you are still outside of your service area  when you receive 
these services.) 
  
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 27 Part 4  
Utilization Review Requirements 
To receive all of the coverage provided by your health plan, you must follow all of the requirements 
described in this section. Your coverage may be denied if you do not follow these requirements.  
Pre-Service Approval Requirements 
There are certain health care services or supplies that must be approved for you by Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue . A health care provider who participates in your health care network will request a pre-service 
approval on your behalf. For the pre-service review, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will consider your 
health care provider to be your authorized representative. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will tell you 
and your health care provider if coverage for a proposed service has been approved or if coverage 
has been denied.  To check on the status of a request or to check for the outcome of a utilization review  
decision, you can call your health care provider or the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. The toll free phone number to call is shown on your ID card. Remember, you should check with 
your health care provider before you receive services or supplies to make sure that your health care provider  
has received approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  when a pre-service approval is required. 
Otherwise, you will have to pay all charges for those health care services and/or supplies. 
Important Note:  You do not need a referral from your primary care provider  or a prior approval from Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from any other person (including your primary care provider ) in order for 
you to access obstetrical care or gynecological care from any network provider  that specializes in this type 
of care. The network provider  may be required to comply with certain pre-service approval requirements. 
For example, pre-approval may be required from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for inpatient 
admissions other than for maternity care. For a list of network providers  who specialize in this type of care, 
you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. See Part 1 for information on 
how you can contact Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
Referrals for Specialty Care 
In most cases, your primary care provider  will furnish your health care. But, if you and your primary care 
provider decide that you need to see a specialist for covered services, your primary care provider  will refer 
you to a network specialist. The specialist will usually be one your primary care provider  knows and is 
probably someone affiliated with your primary care provider’s  hospital or medical group. 
When You Need a Referral to a Specialist 
Except as described below in this section, you will need to have an approved referral from your primary 
care provider  before you receive outpatient  specialty care from a network specialist. You will need a 
referral in order for you to receive coverage from this health plan. When you need a referral to receive care 
from a network specialist, your primary care provider  will obtain an approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  for you. Your referral may be time limited. Or, in some cases, your primary care provider  may 
authorize a “standing” referral for specialty care with a network specialist. Your primary care provider  will 
do this when they determine that the referrals are appropriate and the network specialist agrees to the 
treatment plan. The network specialist will provide your primary care provider  with necessary clinical and 
administrative information on a regular basis. A referral authorizes specific services (and may authorize a 
specific number of visits) that will be needed to diagnose, evaluate, or treat your condition. It is up to you 
to comply with any limits set out in the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  referral approval. It is up to your Part 4 – Utilization Review Requirements  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 28 covered provider to get additional referrals or approvals from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for related 
services. 
There are a few times when you do not need to have a referral from your primary care provider  for you to 
receive coverage from this health plan. You do not need a referral for the following covered services . 
 Emergency medical care . 
 Covered services  that are furnished for you by an obstetrician, a gynecologist, or a nurse midwife; or 
gynecological and related services that are furnished for you by a family practitioner. This includes: a 
covered routine annual gynecological (GYN) exam and any services that are required as a result of 
the exam; and evaluations and health care services that result from acute or emergency gynecological 
conditions. For these covered services , you will not have to pay any more than you would normally 
pay if you had received an approved referral from your primary care provider . But, prior approval is 
required from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for: inpatient admissions (other than those for 
emergency or maternity care); and all infertility treatment. 
 Covered services  that are furnished by a limited services clinic.

 Chiropractor services. (A pre-service approval may be required. See below.)

from a network specialist that is not a designated telehealth vendor.)  
 Urgent care  that is received outside of your service area . 
(If you are enrolled in a New England plan option, the health care services that need a referral from your 
primary care provider  may vary based on the state where your primary care provider  is located.) 
From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may change the list of covered services  that require 
an approved referral from your primary care provider . Your primary care provider  or other covered 
provider can tell you if your covered service  needs a referral. When a material change is made to these 
requirements, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know about the change at least 60 days before 
it becomes effective. To check the requirements, you can use the online Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
member self service option. To do this, log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at 
www.bluecrossma.org . Just follow the steps to check your benefits. 
If you are enrolled in an Access Blue plan option, these referral requirements do not apply. This means that 
an approved referral from your primary care provider  is not required for you to receive coverage for 
specialty care that is furnished by a network specialist. But, a pre-service approval may be required as 
described below in this Part 4. 
Pre-Service Review for Outpatient Services 
To receive all of your coverage for certain outpatient  health services and supplies, you must obtain a 
pre-service approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . A provider who participates in your health 
care network will request this approval on your behalf. During the pre-service review, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will determine if your proposed health care services or supplies should be covered as Part 4 – Utilization Review Requirements  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 29 medically necessary  for your condition. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this decision within 
two working days of the date that it receives all of the needed information from your health care provider. 
You must receive a pre-service approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for: 
 Certain outpatient  specialty care, procedures, services, and supplies. Some examples of services that 
may require prior approval include: some types of surgery; non-emergency ground ambulance; and 
certain outpatient  treatment plans that require a review due to factors such as (but not limited to) the 
variability in length of treatment, the difficulty in predicting a standard length of treatment, the risk 
factors and provider discretion in determining treatment intensity compared to symptoms, the 
difficulty in measuring outcomes, or the variability in cost and quality. To find out if a treatment, 
service, or supply needs a pre-service review, you can check with your health care provider. 
You can also find out by calling the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office or 
using the online Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  member self service option. To check online, 
log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at www.bluecrossma.org. Just follow 
the steps to check your benefits.  
 Infertility treatment. 
 Certain prescription drugs that you buy from a pharmacy or that are administered to you by a 
non-pharmacy health care provider during a covered visit. For example, you receive an injection or an 
infusion of a drug in a physician’s office or in a hospital outpatient setting. A key part of this 
pre-service approval process is the step therapy program. It helps your health care provider provide 
you with the appropriate drug treatment. To find out if your prescription drug requires a prior 
approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
customer service office. 
(If you are enrolled in a New England plan option, the health care services that need a pre-service approval 
may vary based on the state where your primary care provider  is located.) 
From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may change the list of health care services and 
supplies that require a prior approval. When a material change is made to these requirements, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let the subscriber  (or the subscriber’s  group on your behalf when you are 
enrolled in this health plan as a  group member ) know about the change at least 60 days before the change 
becomes effective. 
Missing Information 
In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will need more information or records to determine if 
your proposed health care services or supplies should be covered as medically necessary  to treat your 
condition. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may ask for the results of a face-to-face clinical 
evaluation or of a second opinion. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  does need more information, Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for this missing information or records within 15 calendar days of 
the date that it received your health care provider’s request for pre-service approval. The information or

Blue within 45 calendar days of the request. If this information or these records are not provided to Blue

Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision within two working days of the date it is received.

Pre-Admission Review 
Before you go into a hospital or other covered health care facility for inpatient care, your health care 
provider must obtain an approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  in order for your care to be 
covered by this health plan. (This does not apply to your admission if it is for emergency medical care  or 
for maternity care.) Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will determine if the health care setting is suitable 
to treat your condition. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this decision within two working days 
of the date that it receives all of the needed information from your health care provider. Any pre-admission 
review approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  applies to your inpatient admission only. There 
may be certain health care services or supplies that are furnished during your admission that also require 
pre-service approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . See “Pre-Service Approval Requirements” 
above in this section. 
Exception:  If your admission is for substance use treatment in a hospital or other covered health care 
facility that is certified or licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, prior approval from

facilities, coverage will be provided for medically necessary  acute treatment services and clinical 
stabilization services for up to a total of 14 days without prior approval, as long as the health care facility 
notifies Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and provides the initial treatment plan within 48 hours of your Part 4 – Utilization Review Requirements  (continued)

WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 32 Concurrent Review and Discharge Planning 
Concurrent Review means that while you are an inpatient, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will monitor 
and review the health care services you receive to make sure you still need inpatient coverage in that facility. 
In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may determine upon review that you will need to continue 
inpatient coverage in that health care facility beyond the number of days first thought to be required for 
your condition. When Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  makes this decision (within one working day of 
receiving all necessary information), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let the health care facility 
know of the coverage approval status of the review. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue will do this within 
one working day of making this decision. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will also send a written (or 
electronic) notice to you and to the facility to explain the decision. This notice will be sent within one 
working day of that first notice. This notice will include: the number of additional days that are being 
approved for coverage (or the next review date); the new total number of approved days or services; and 
the date the approved services will begin. 
In other cases, based on a medical necessity  determination, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may 
determine that you no longer need inpatient coverage in that health care facility. Or, you may no longer 
need inpatient coverage at all. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this decision within one 
working day of receiving all necessary information. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will call the health 
care facility to let them know of this decision. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will discuss plans for 
continued coverage in a health care setting that better meets your needs. This phone call will be made within 
24 hours of the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  coverage decision. For example, your condition may no 
longer require inpatient coverage in a hospital, but it still may require skilled nursing coverage. If this is 
the case, your physician may decide to transfer you to a skilled nursing facility. Any proposed plans will 
be discussed with you by your physician. All arrangements for discharge planning will be confirmed in 
writing with you. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send this written (or electronic) notice to you and 
to the facility within one working day of that phone call to the facility. You may choose to stay in the health 
care facility after you have been told by your health care provider  or Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
that inpatient coverage is no longer medically  necessary . But, if you do, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
will not provide any more coverage (except as otherwise may be required during the formal review process). 
You must pay all costs for the rest of that inpatient stay. This starts from the date the written notice is sent 
to you from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
Reconsideration of Adverse Determination 
Your health care provider may ask that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  reconsider its decision when 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has determined that continued inpatient coverage is not medically 
necessary for your condition. In this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will arrange for the decision 
to be reviewed by a clinical peer reviewer. This review will be held between your health care provider and 
the clinical peer reviewer. And, it will be held within one working day of the date that your health care 
provider asks for the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decision to be reconsidered. If the initial decision 
is not reversed, you (or the health care provider on your behalf) may ask for a formal review. The process 
to ask for a formal review is described in Part 10 of this Subscriber Certificate. You may request a formal 
review even if your health care provider has not asked that the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decision 
be reconsidered. 
Individual Case Management 
Individual Case Management is a flexible program for managing your benefits in some situations. Through 
this program, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  works with your health care providers to make sure that 
you get medically necessary  services in the least intensive setting that meets your needs. Under this Part 4 – Utilization Review Requirements  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 33 program, coverage may be approved for services that are in addition to those that are already covered by 
this health plan. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may approve these services to: 
 Shorten an inpatient stay. This may occur by sending a member home or to a less intensive setting to 
continue treatment. 
 Direct a member to a less costly setting when an inpatient stay has been proposed. 
 Prevent future inpatient stays. This may occur by providing coverage for outpatient  care instead. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may, in some situations, present a specific alternative treatment plan to 
you and your attending physician. This treatment plan will be one that is medically necessary  for you. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will need the full cooperation of everyone involved. This includes: the patient 
(or the guardian); the hospital; the attending physician; and the proposed health care provider. Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  may require that there be a written agreement between the patient (or the patient’s 
family or guardian) and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also 
require that there be an agreement between the health care provider and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
to furnish the services that are approved through this alternative treatment plan.

needs. In this case, you must pay all of the health care provider’s charges that are more than the Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  claim payment.

admission. These tests provide a radiological image of the internal body. These types of tests can be 
low-tech radiology services, such as ultrasounds or x-rays. Or, they can be high-tech radiology 
services, such as computerized axial tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
positron emission tomography (PET scans), and nuclear cardiac imaging. Imaging tests may pair 
pictures of the body with functional measurements, such as a barium swallow test. 
 Other diagnostic tests not described above. These tests are used: to confirm or diagnose health 
problems; to monitor a condition; and/or to determine a course of treatment. Some examples of 
diagnostic tests are: capsule endoscopy; transcranial doppler study; and diagnostic machine tests, such 
as pulmonary function tests and Holter monitoring.

unit admission for surgery. And, they must not be repeated during the admission. Some examples of 
these tests are: diagnostic lab tests; diagnostic x-ray and other imaging tests ; and diagnostic machine 
tests.

furnished during an emergency room visit or during a day surgery admission, or at a hospital and the results 
of the lab test(s) are required right away so the hospital can furnish treatment to you. You can call the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office for information about the times when your copayment  
may be waived. The toll free phone number to call is shown on your ID card. Your Schedule of Benefits

 Page 50 Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment 
This health plan covers  medically necessary  services to diagnose and/or treat mental conditions . This 
coverage includes: 
 Biologically-based mental conditions . “Biologically-based mental conditions” means: schizophrenia; 
schizoaffective disorder; major depressive disorder; bipolar disorder; paranoia and other psychotic 
disorders; obsessive-compulsive disorder; panic disorder; delirium and dementia; affective disorders; 
eating disorders; post-traumatic stress disorders; autism; substance use disorders (such as drug and

Disorders that are scientifically recognized and approved by the Commissioner of the Department of 
Mental Health. 
 Rape-related mental  or emotional disorders for victims of a rape or victims of an assault with intent to 
rape. 
 Non-biologically-based mental, behavior, or emotional disorders of enrolled dependent children who 
are under age 19. This coverage includes pediatric specialty mental health care that is furnished by a 
mental health provider  who has a recognized expertise in specialty pediatrics. (This coverage is not 
limited to those disorders that substantially interfere with or limit the way the child functions or how 
they interact with others.) If a child who is under age 19 is receiving an ongoing course of treatment, 
this coverage will continue to be provided after the child’s 19th birthday until that ongoing course of 
treatment is completed, provided that the child or someone acting on behalf of the child continues to 
pay for coverage in this health plan in accordance with federal (COBRA) or state law, or the child 
enrolls with no lapse in coverage under another Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO 
Blue, Inc. or Blue Cross and Blue Shield  of Massachusetts, Inc. health plan. 
 All other non-biologically-based mental conditions  not described above. 
No benefits  are provided for: 
 Psychiatric services for a condition that is not a mental condition . 
 Residential or other care that is custodial care . 
 Services and/or programs that are not medically necessary  to treat your mental condition . 
 Services and/or programs that are performed in educational or vocational settings; or, services and/or 
programs that are not considered to be inpatient services, intermediate treatments, or outpatient 
services as described below in this section. These types of non-covered programs may be in 
residential or nonresidential settings and may include: therapeutic elements and therapy services; 
clinical staff (such as licensed mental health counselors) and clinical staff services; and vocational, 
educational, problem solving, and/or recreational activities. These non-covered programs may have 
state licensure and/or educational accreditation. But, they do not provide the clinically appropriate 
level of care required for coverage under this health plan. No benefits are provided for any services 
furnished along with one of these non-covered programs. The only exception is for outpatient  covered 
services to diagnose and/or treat mental conditions  when these services are performed by a covered 
provider. Your coverage for these covered services  is provided to the same extent as coverage is 
provided for similar covered services to diagnose and treat a mental condition . Part 5 – Covered Services  (continued)

 Page 51 Inpatient Services 
Usually, to receive coverage for inpatient services, you and your mental health provider must receive 
approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as outlined in this Subscriber Certificate before you enter 
a hospital or other covered facility. (See Part 4 for these requirements.) Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
will let you and your mental health provider  know when your coverage is approved. When inpatient care 
is approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , this health plan provides coverage for as many days as 
are medically necessary  for you. This coverage includes: semiprivate room and board  and special services ; 
and psychiatric care that is furnished for you by a physician (who is a specialist in psychiatry), or by a 
psychologist, or by a clinical specialist in psychiatric and mental health nursing, or by another mental health 
provider. 
Intermediate Treatments 
There may be times when you  will need medically necessary  care that is more intensive than typical 
outpatient  care. But, you do not need 24-hour inpatient hospital care. This intermediate care may include 
(but is not limited to): 
 Acute residential treatment (this is substantially similar to Community-Based Acute Treatment 
(CBAT) programs described below in this section), clinically managed detoxification services, or 
crisis stabilization services. These services may sometimes be referred to as sub-acute care services. 
These services offer 24 hours a day, 7 days a week access to medical services and on-site or on-call 
nursing staff. Your coverage for these services is considered to be an inpatient benefit. During the 
inpatient pre-service review process (see Part 4), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will assess your 
specific health care needs. The least intensive type of setting that is required for your mental 
condition  will be approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
 Partial hospital programs, intensive outpatient programs, day treatment programs, in-home therapy 
services, or mobile crisis intervention services. Your coverage for these services is considered to be 
an outpatient  benefit, even if you use a bed or spend the night. 
In addition to the services listed above, this health plan also covers certain intermediate care for members 
who are under age 19, such as: 
 Community-Based Acute Treatment (CBAT) programs that provide mental health care in a 
staff-secure setting on a 24-hour basis, with sufficient clinical staffing to ensure the member’s safety, 
while providing intensive therapeutic services including (but not limited to): daily medication 
monitoring; psychiatric assessment; nursing availability; specialing (as needed); individual, group, 
and family therapy; case management; family assessment and consultation; discharge planning; and 
psychological testing, as needed. Or, you may require services of higher intensity than those provided 
by a CBAT program, including more frequent psychiatric and psychopharmacological evaluation and 
treatment and more intensive staffing and service delivery. This may be delivered through an 
Intensive Community-Based Acute Treatment (ICBAT) program. ICBAT programs may admit 
members with more acute symptoms than those admitted to CBAT. ICBAT programs are able to treat 
members with clinical symptoms that are similar to those which would be treated under inpatient 
mental health care but who are able to be cared for safely in an unlocked setting. Your coverage for 
these CBAT and ICBAT programs is considered to be an inpatient benefit. During the inpatient 
pre-service review process (see Part 4), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will assess your specific Part 5 – Covered Services  (continued)

 In-home behavioral services that provide a combination of medically  necessary  behavior management 
therapy and behavior management monitoring. These services  may be furnished where the member 
resides, including in the member’s  home, a foster home, a therapeutic foster home, or another 
community setting. Behavior management monitoring is the monitoring of behavior, the 
implementation of a behavior plan, and reinforcing the implementation of a behavior plan by the 
member’s  parent or other caregiver. Behavior management therapy addresses challenging behaviors 
that interfere with a member’s  successful functioning. Behavior management therapy includes: a 
functional behavioral assessment and observation of the member in the home and/or community 
setting; development of a behavior plan; and supervision and coordination of interventions to address 
specific behavioral goals or performance, including the development of a crisis-response strategy. 
Behavior management therapy may also include short-term counseling and assistance. Your coverage 
for these services is considered to be an outpatient  benefit. 
 In-Home Therapy services that provide medically  necessary  therapeutic clinical intervention or 
ongoing therapeutic training and support. These services  are furnished where the member resides, 
including in the member’s  home, a foster home, a therapeutic foster home, or another community

between a licensed clinician and a member and their family to treat the member’s  mental health needs, 
including improvement of the family’s ability to provide effective support for the member and 
promotion of health functioning of the member within the family; the development of a treatment 
plan; and the use of established psychotherapeutic techniques, working with the family or a subset of 
the family to enhance problem solving, limit setting, communication, emotional support or other 
family or individual functions. Ongoing therapeutic training and support services support the 
implementation of a treatment plan following therapeutic clinical intervention. These services include 
(but are not limited to): teaching the member to understand, direct, interpret, manage, and control 
feelings and emotional responses to situations; and assisting the family in supporting the member and 
addressing the member’s emotional and mental health needs. Your coverage for these services is 
considered to be an outpatient  benefit. (These In-Home Therapy services are in addition to the 
“in-home therapy” services described above.) 
 Family support and training services that provide medically necessary assistance to the member’s 
parent or caregiver to increase their ability to reduce or resolve the member’s  emotional or mental 
health needs. These services  are furnished where the member resides, including in the member’s  
home, a foster home, a therapeutic foster home, or another community setting. Family support and 
training services support one or more goals on the member’s  treatment plan. These services include 
(but are not limited to): educating the member’s parent or caregiver about the member’s  mental health 
needs and resiliency factors; teaching the member’s parent or caregiver how to access and use 
available services on behalf of the member; and how to identify formal and informal services and 
support in their communities, including parent support and self-help groups. Your coverage for these 
services is considered to be an outpatient  benefit.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. These services  are furnished where the 
member resides, including in the member’s  home, a foster home, a therapeutic foster home, or another 
community setting. Therapeutic mentoring is a skill building service that supports one or more goals 
on the member’s  treatment plan. These services include (but are not limited to): supporting, coaching, 
and training the member in age-appropriate behaviors; interpersonal communication; problem 
solving; conflict resolution; and relating appropriately to other children, adolescents, and adults. Your 
coverage for these services is considered to be an outpatient  benefit. 
 Intensive care coordination services that provide targeted case management services to eligible 
members with serious emotional disturbance(s) in order to meet the comprehensive medical, mental 
health, and psychosocial needs of a member and the member’s  family. These services include: an 
assessment; the development of an individualized care plan; referrals to appropriate levels of care; 
monitoring of goals; and coordinating with other services and social supports and with state agencies, 
as indicated. These services include both face-to-face and telephone meetings. These services may be 
furnished in the provider’s office or in the member’s  home or in other settings, as clinically 
appropriate. Your coverage for these services is considered to be an outpatient  benefit. 
 Mobile crisis intervention services that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide 
short-term, mobile, on-site, face-to-face therapeutic responses to a member experiencing a behavioral 
health crisis. Mobile crisis intervention is used: to identify, assess, treat, and stabilize a situation; to 
reduce the immediate risk of danger to the member or others; and to make referrals and linkages to all 
medically necessary behavioral health services and supports and the appropriate level of care. Mobile 
crisis intervention includes a crisis assessment and crisis planning, which may result in the 
development or update of a crisis safety plan. Your coverage for these services is considered to be an 
outpatient  benefit. 
These intermediate treatments may be considered an inpatient benefit or an outpatient  benefit. If you would 
normally pay a copayment  for inpatient or outpatient  benefits, the copayment  will be waived when you get 
covered intermediate care. But, you must still pay your deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies.  
No benefits  are provided for: a program for which  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not able to conduct 
concurrent review of continued medical necessity  (see Part 4), including a program that has a pre-defined 
length of care or stay; a program that provides only meetings or activities that are not based on an 
individualized treatment plan; and a program that focuses solely on the improvement of interpersonal or 
other skills, rather than on treatment that is focused on symptom reduction and functional recovery for 
specific mental conditions .

the Drug Formulary exception request is approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , you will receive 
coverage for the drug that is not on the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Drug Formulary. For this drug, 
you will pay the member cost share amount that you would pay if this drug were a non-preferred prescription 
drug. 
Buying Covered Drugs and Supplies 
For help to obtain your drug coverage, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. The toll free phone number to call is shown on your ID  card. A Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
customer service representative can help you find a pharmacy where you may buy a specific drug or supply. 
They can also help you find out which member cost share level you will pay for a specific covered drug or 
supply. Or, you can also go online and log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at 
www.bluecrossma.org . 
Mail Order Pharmacy Benefits 
There are certain covered drugs and supplies that you may not be able to buy from the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  designated mail order pharmacy. To find out if your covered drug or supply qualifies for 
the mail order pharmacy benefit, you can check with the mail order pharmacy. Or, you can call the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service office. 
Mail Order with Retail Choice Program 
Some plan options include the Mail Order with Retail Choice Program. The Schedule of Benefits  for your 
plan option will tell you when you have this program. (Also refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to 
your coverage in this health plan.) If your health plan includes this program, the Mail Order with Retail 
Choice Program applies for certain covered maintenance drugs. These drugs are shown on the Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  drug list. When you buy any one of these maintenance drugs from a covered retail 
pharmacy, this health plan covers only two fills of the same drug within a 365-day period. In order to receive 
coverage for more fills of the same drug from a covered retail pharmacy, you will be asked to choose 
whether you want to continue to receive your drug fills from the retail pharmacy or whether you will receive 
your drug fills from the covered mail order pharmacy. After you buy your first fill of the listed drug from 
the retail pharmacy, you will receive a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield  HMO Blue  that will tell you how 
to make your choice. If you do not make a choice before you buy a third fill, the covered mail order 
pharmacy will automatically qualify as your choice. No retail pharmacy coverage will be provided for more 
than two fills of the same drug unless you have chosen the retail pharmacy option. To find out which 
maintenance drugs are on the drug list, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. The toll free phone number to call is shown on your ID card. Or, you can also go online and log on Part 5 – Covered Services  (continued)

that you must pay for covered services  and for the benefit limits that may apply to specific covered 
services. Once you reach your benefit limit  for a specific covered service , no more benefits are

these services, coverage is provided only for those services that are determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  to be medically necessary  for you. 
This coverage is also provided when the short-term therapy is medically necessary  habilitation therapy. 
Coverage for short-term habilitation therapy is most often included in the benefit limit  for short-term 
rehabilitation therapy. But, the benefit limit  for short-term habilitation therapy may be separate from the 
benefit limit  for short-term rehabilitation therapy. If this is the case, the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan 
option describes the separate benefit limits  that apply for these covered services . (Also refer to riders—if 
there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.)

and functioning that have been lost or impaired because a person was sick, hurt, or disabled. Habilitation 
services are those health care services that help a person keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for 
daily living. Part 5 – Covered Services  (continued)

provided for the harvesting of the donor’s organ (or tissue) or stem cells when the recipient is not 
a member. (See “Lab Tests, X-Rays, and Other Tests” for your coverage for donor testing.) 
 Oral surgery.  This means: reduction of a dislocation or fracture of the jaw or facial bone; 
excision of a benign or malignant tumor of the jaw; and orthognathic surgery that you need to 
correct a significant functional impairment that cannot be adequately corrected with orthodontic 
services. This coverage is provided when the surgery is furnished at a facility, provided that you 
have a serious medical condition that requires that you be admitted to a surgical day care unit of a 
hospital or to an ambulatory surgical facility in order for the surgery to be safely performed. This 
coverage is also provided when the surgery is furnished at an oral surgeon’s office. (Orthognathic 
surgery is not covered when it is performed mainly for cosmetic reasons. This surgery must be 
performed along with orthodontic services. If it is not, the oral surgeon must send a letter to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  asking for approval for the surgery. No benefits are provided for the 
orthodontic services, except as described in this Subscriber Certificate on page 39 for the 
treatment of conditions of cleft lip and cleft palate.)

waived for these covered services . Any deductible  and coinsurance  will still apply. 
If a covered provider’s  office is located at, or professional services are billed by, a hospital, your cost share 
is the same amount as for an office visit. 
Coverage for Self Injectable and Certain Other Drugs Furnished in an Office or Health Center 
There are self injectable and certain other prescription drugs used for treating your medical condition that 
are covered by this health plan only when these covered drugs are furnished by a covered pharmacy, even 
when a non-pharmacy health care provider administers the covered drug for you during a covered office or 
health center visit. For your coverage for these drugs, see “Prescription Drugs and Supplies.” No benefits 
are provided for the cost of these drugs when the drug is furnished by a non-pharmacy health care 
provider.  For a list of these drugs, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. Or, you can log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at www.bluecrossma.org .

department.) 
Telehealth Services 
This health plan covers telehealth services that are furnished by a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
network provider  or by a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  designated telehealth vendor. Telehealth 
services are synchronous or asynchronous communications (audio, video, or other approved electronic 
media or telecommunications technology including, but not limited to: interactive audio-video technology; 
remote patient monitoring devices; audio-only telephone; and online adaptive interviews) between you and 
the health care provider. Your health care provider will work with you to determine if a telehealth visit is 
medically appropriate for your health care needs or if an in-person visit is required. These services are 
available for medically appropriate covered services , including services to diagnose and/or treat mental 
conditions . The cost share amount that you will pay depends on the health care provider that furnishes the 
covered service  to you. (See below.) For covered telehealth services, you will not have to pay any more 
than you would normally pay for the same in-person covered service  with your health care provider. In 
some cases, the cost share amount that you will pay for covered telehealth services may be less than you 
would pay for an in-person visit. Part 5 – Covered Services  (continued) 
IMPORTANT: Refer to the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option for the cost share amounts 
that you must pay for covered services  and for the benefit limits that may apply to specific covered 
services. Once you reach your benefit limit  for a specific covered service , no more benefits are 
provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for those services or supplies. 
 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 69 Note: Any benefit limits that may apply for a specific covered service  will still apply when the covered 
service is furnished as a telehealth service. The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option and/or any riders 
that apply to your coverage in this health plan describe any benefit limits  that apply to your coverage.  
Telehealth Services with a Network Provider 
When medically appropriate telehealth services are furnished by a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
network provider , your cost share (such as deductible , copayment , and/or coinsurance ) is the same amount 
as an in-person visit with that provider. Your Schedule of Benefits  describes your cost share amount. (Also 
refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) Your cost share for 
covered telehealth services may be lower than your in-person cost share. If this is the case, this will be 
described in a rider. Except as described in Part 4 for certain services, you will need to have an approved 
referral from your primary care provider  before you receive outpatient  specialty care from a network 
specialist. 
Telehealth Services with a Designated Telehealth Vendor 
You may use a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue designated telehealth vendor when you need care for a 
minor illness or injury such as a cough, a sore throat, or a fever; or you need care for a chronic condition; 
or you need mental health and substance use care for conditions or symptoms such as anxiety and 
depression; or you have a general health and wellness concern. You do not need a referral from your 
primary care provider  for covered outpatient  telehealth services with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
designated telehealth vendor. 
When medically appropriate outpatient  telehealth services are furnished by a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue designated telehealth vendor, your cost share (such as deductible , copayment , and/or coinsurance ) is 
the same telehealth cost share when they are furnished by your primary care provider (if you are enrolled 
in an Options tiered network plan, your cost share is the same as the lowest cost share level for a primary 
care provider office visit) or  mental health provider . Your Schedule of Benefits  describes your cost share 
amount. (Also refer to riders—if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) Your cost 
share for covered outpatient  telehealth services with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue designated 
telehealth vendor may be lower than your in-person cost share for a primary care provider office visit. If 
this is the case, this will be described in a rider. 
Exception for members with a virtual care team primary care provider : When your specific plan option 
includes the “Virtual Care Team Model” rider and you choose (or designate) a Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  virtual care team covered provider  as your primary care provider , your cost share for outpatient  
telehealth services furnished by a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue designated telehealth vendor is not the 
same cost share for outpatient  telehealth services as described above. 
For outpatient  telehealth services furnished by a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue designated telehealth 
vendor, your cost share is the same telehealth cost share that you would pay for covered services  furnished 
by a primary care provider  that is not a virtual care team primary care provider  as described in your 
Schedule of Benefits  and/or riders that apply to your coverage in this health plan. Or, when you are enrolled 
in an Options tiered network plan, your cost share is the same telehealth cost share as an Enhanced Benefits Part 5 – Covered Services  (continued) 
IMPORTANT: Refer to the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option for the cost share amounts 
that you must pay for covered services  and for the benefit limits that may apply to specific covered 
services. Once you reach your benefit limit  for a specific covered service , no more benefits are 
provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for those services or supplies.

This health plan covers outpatient  services that are furnished for you by a covered provider  to diagnose 
and/or treat temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders that are caused by or result in a specific medical

Blue Shield HMO Blue  is able to coordinate your care. This coverage is  subject to all of the provisions that 
are described in this Subscriber Certificate, your Schedule of Benefits , and any riders that apply to your 
coverage in this health plan. 
Benefits from Other Sources 
No benefits are provided for health care services and supplies to treat an illness or injury for which you 
have the right to benefits under government programs. These include the Veterans Administration for an 
illness or injury connected to military service. They also include programs set up by other local, state, 
federal, or foreign laws or regulations that provide or pay for health care services and supplies or that require 
care or treatment to be furnished in a public facility. No benefits are provided by this health plan if you 
could have received governmental benefits by applying for them on time. This exclusion does not include 
Medicaid or Medicare. 
Cosmetic Services and Procedures 
No benefits are provided for cosmetic services that are performed solely for the purpose of making you 
look better. This is the case whether or not these services are meant to make you feel better about yourself

the removal of acne cysts, injections to raise acne scars, cosmetic surgery, and dermabrasion or other 
procedures to plane the skin; electrolysis; hair removal or restoration (except as described in Part 5 for scalp 
hair prostheses); and liposuction. (See Part 5 for your coverage for reconstructive surgery.) 
There may be services that are usually considered cosmetic services but that meet Blue Cross Blue Shield

medical policies or medical technology assessment criteria . 
Custodial Care 
No benefits are provided for custodial care . This type of care may be furnished with or without routine

 Page 72 Dental Care 
Except as described otherwise in this Subscriber Certificate or your Schedule of Benefits , no benefits are 
provided for treatment that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines to be for dental care. This is the 
case even when the dental condition is related to or caused by a medical condition or medical treatment. 
There is one exception. This health plan will cover facility charges  when you have a serious medical 
condition that requires that you be admitted to a hospital as an inpatient or to a surgical day care unit of a 
hospital or to an ambulatory surgical facility in order for your dental care to be safely performed. Some 
examples of serious medical conditions are: hemophilia; and heart disease. 
Educational Testing and Evaluations 
No benefits are provided for exams, evaluations, or services that are performed solely for educational or 
developmental purposes. The only exceptions are for: covered early intervention services; treatment of 
mental conditions  for enrolled dependents who are under age 19; and covered services  to diagnose and/or 
treat speech, hearing, and language disorders. (See Part 5.) 
Exams or Treatment Required by a Third Party

services that are required by third parties. Some examples of non- covered services  are: exams and tests that 
are required for recreational activities, employment, insurance, and school; and court-ordered exams and 
services, except when they are medically necessary  services. (But, certain exams may be covered when 
they are furnished as part of a covered routine physical exam. See Part 5.) 
Experimental Services and Procedures 
This health plan provides coverage only for covered services  that are furnished according to Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical technology  assessment criteria . No benefits are provided for health care 
charges that are received for or related to care that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  considers 
experimental services or procedures. The fact that a treatment is offered as a last resort does not mean that 
this health plan will cover it. There are two exceptions. As required by law, this health plan will cover: 
 One or more stem cell (“bone marrow”) transplants for a member who has been diagnosed with breast 
cancer that has spread. The member must meet the eligibility standards that have been set by the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

treat cancer; drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS; and, long-term antibiotic therapy drugs for the treatment

would give a member having particular symptoms the ability to detect or stop the onset of a sudden 
life-threatening condition. 
Missed Appointments 
No benefits are provided for charges for appointments that you do not keep. Physicians and other health 
care providers may charge you if you do not keep your scheduled appointments. They may do so if you do 
not give them reasonable notice. You must pay for these costs. Appointments that you do not keep are not 
counted against any benefit limits  that apply to your coverage in this health plan.

You must include information on your enrollment forms about all other health plans under which you are 
covered. Once you are enrolled in this health plan, you must notify Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  if 
you add or change health plan coverage. Upon Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  request, you must also 
supply Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  with information about other plans that may provide you with 
coverage for health care services. 
Under COB, the plan that provides benefits first is known as the primary payor. And the plan(s) that provide 
benefits next are known as the secondary payor(s). When coverage in this health plan is secondary, no 
coverage will be provided until after the primary payor determines its share, if any, of the liability. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decides which is the primary and secondary payor. To do this, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  relies on Massachusetts law, including the COB regulations issued by the 
Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A copy of these rules is available from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue upon request. Unless otherwise required by law, coverage in this health plan will be secondary when 
another plan provides you with coverage for health care services. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not provide any more coverage than what is described in this 
Subscriber Certificate. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not provide duplicate benefits for covered 
services. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  pays more than the amount that it should have under COB, 
then you must give that amount back to  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue has the right to get that amount back from you or any appropriate person, insurance company, or other 
organization. 
Important Notice: If you fail to comply with the provisions of this COB section, payment of your claim 
may be denied. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s Rights to Recover Benefit Payments 
Subrogation and Reimbursement of Benefit Payments 
If you are injured by any act or omission of another person, the benefits under this health plan will be 
subrogated. This means that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may use your right to recover money from 
the person(s) who caused the injury or from any insurance company or other party. If you recover money, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is entitled to recover up to the amount of the benefit payments that it 
has made. This is true no matter where or by whom the recovered money is held or how it is designated and 
even if you do not recover the total amount of your claim against the other person(s). This is also true if the 
payment you receive is described as payment for other than health care expenses. The amount that you must 
reimburse to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not be reduced by any attorney’s fees or expenses that 
you incur. Part 7 – Other Party Liability  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 77 Member Cooperation 
You must give Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  information and help. This means you must complete 
and sign all necessary documents to help Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  get this money back. This also 
means that you must give  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  timely notice of all significant steps during 
negotiation, litigation, or settlement with any third party (such as filing a claim or lawsuit, initiation of 
settlement discussions, agreement to a settlement in principle, etc.) and before settling any claim arising 
out of injuries you sustained by an act or omission of another person(s) for which Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  paid benefits. You must not do anything that might limit Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  
right to full reimbursement. 
Workers’ Compensation 
No benefits are provided for health care services that are furnished to treat an illness or injury that Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines was work related. This is the case even if you have an agreement 
with the workers’ compensation carrier that releases them from paying for the claims. All employers 
provide their employees with workers’ compensation or similar insurance. This is done to protect 
employees in case of a work-related illness or injury. All health care claims for a work-related illness or 
injury must be billed to the employer’s workers’ compensation carrier. It is up to you to use the workers’ 
compensation insurance. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  pays for any work-related health care 
services, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has the right to get paid back from the party that legally must 
pay for the health care claims. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  also has the right, where possible, to 
reverse payments made to providers. 
If you have recovered any benefits from a workers’ compensation insurer (or from an employer liability 
plan), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has the right to recover from you the amount of benefits it has 
paid for your health care services. This is the case even if: 
 the workers’ compensation benefits are in dispute or are made by means of a settlement or 
compromise; 
 no final determination is made that an injury or illness was sustained in the course of or resulted from 
your employment; 
 the amount of workers’ compensation due to medical or health care is not agreed upon or defined by 
you or the workers’ compensation carrier; or 
 the medical or health care benefits are specifically excluded from the workers’ compensation 
settlement or compromise. 
If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is billed in error for these services, you must promptly call or write to 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office.

Other Health Plan Provisions 
Access to and Confidentiality of Medical Records 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and health care providers  may, in accordance with applicable law, have 
access to all of your medical records and related information that is needed by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue or health care providers. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may collect information from health care 
providers or from other insurance companies or the plan sponsor  (for group members ). Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will use this information to help them administer the coverage provided by this health 
plan and to get facts on the quality of care that is provided under this and other health care contracts. In 
accordance with law, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and health care providers  may use this information 
and may disclose it to necessary persons and entities as permitted and required by law. For example, Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may use and disclose it as follows: 
 For administering coverage (including coordination of benefits with other insurance plans); managing 
care; quality assurance; utilization management; the prescription drug history program; appeal and 
claims review activities; or other specific business, professional, or insurance functions for Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
 For bona fide medical research according to the regulations of the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the protection of human 
subjects. 
 As required by law or valid court order. 
 As required by government or regulatory agencies. 
 As necessary for the operations of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. 
 As required by the subscriber’s  group or by its auditors to make sure that Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  is administering your coverage in this health plan properly. (This applies only when you 
are enrolled in this health plan as a group member .) 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not share information about you with the Medical Information 
Bureau (MIB). Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  respects your right to privacy. Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will not use or disclose personally identifiable information about you without your permission, 
unless the use or disclosure is permitted or required by law and is done in accordance with the law. You 
have the right to get the information Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  collects about you. You may also 
ask Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to correct any of this information that you believe is not correct. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may charge you a reasonable fee for copying your records, unless your 
request is because Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is declining or terminating your coverage in this 
health plan. 
Important Notice: To get a copy of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  Commitment to Confidentiality 
statement (“Notice of Privacy Practices”), call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. (See Part 1.) 
Acts of Providers 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not liable for the acts or omissions by any individuals or institutions 
that furnish care or services to you. In addition, a health care provider who participates in your health care 
network and has a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or any other health care Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 79 provider does not act as an agent on behalf of or for Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . And, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  does not act as an agent for health care providers who participate in your health care 
network and have payment agreements with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or for any other health care 
providers. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not interfere with the relationship between health care providers 
and their patients. You are free to select or discharge any health care provider. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue is not responsible if a provider refuses to furnish services to you. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
does not guarantee that you will be admitted to any facility or that you will get a special type of room or 
service. If you are admitted to a facility, you will be subject to all of its requirements. This includes its 
requirements on admission, discharge, and the availability of services. 
Assignment of Benefits 
You cannot assign any benefit or monies due from this health plan to any person, corporation, or other 
organization without Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  written consent. Any assignment by you will be 
void. Assignment means the transfer of your rights to the benefits provided by this health plan to another 
person or organization. There is one exception. If Medicaid has already paid the health care provider, you 
can assign your benefits to Medicaid. 
Authorized Representative and Legal Representative 
You may choose to have another person act on your behalf concerning your health care coverage in this 
health plan. Some examples are a designated authorized representative or a documented legal 
representative. An authorized representative is a person you have chosen to help with your health care issues 
and to whom Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue is allowed to disclose and discuss your protected health 
information (PHI). An authorized representative is not a person who has legal authority to act on your 
behalf. A legal representative is a person who has legal authority to act on your behalf in making decisions 
about your health care. They may be someone who has legal authority for: power of attorney for health 
care; guardianship; conservatorship; executor of estate; or health care proxy. A legal representative may 
also be a person documented through a court order to act on your behalf in making decisions about your 
health care. To designate an authorized representative or document a legal representative, you must let Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  know in writing by completing the appropriate form(s). To get copies of these 
forms, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The toll free phone 
number to call is shown on your ID card. You may also log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
Web site at www.bluecrossma.org  to get a copy of these forms. In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue may consider your health care facility or your physician or other health care provider to be your 
authorized representative. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may tell your hospital that a 
proposed inpatient admission has been approved. Or, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may ask your 
physician for more information if more is needed for Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to make a decision. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will consider the health care provider to be your authorized 
representative for emergency medical care . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will continue to send benefit 
payments and written communications regarding your health care coverage according to Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue’s  standard practices, unless you specifically ask Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to do 
otherwise. 
Changes to Health Plan Coverage 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may change the provisions of your coverage in this health plan. (When 
you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , the plan sponsor  may also change a part of the 
group contract.) For example, a change may be made to the cost share amount that you must pay for certain Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 80 covered services  such as your copayment  or your deductible  or your coinsurance . When Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  makes a material change to your coverage in this health plan,  Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will send a notice about the change at least 60 days before the effective date of the change. The 
notice will be sent to the subscriber  or, when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , to the 
plan sponsor . The notice from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will describe the change being made. It 
will also give the effective date  of the change. If you are enrolled as a group member , the plan sponsor  
should deliver to its group members all notices from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (If you enrolled in 
this health plan through the Massachusetts Health Connector, see Part 11 or Part 12, whichever applies to 
you, for information.) 
There may be times when the provisions of your coverage in this health plan change but Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  is not able to provide prior notice of the change as described above. These changes may 
be made by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as a result of events beyond its control such as: war; riot; 
national emergency; terrorist attack; public health emergency; pandemic; or natural disaster. When this 
happens, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a determination to provide services under this health 
plan based on the severity of the event and the needs of its members enrolled under this health plan during 
this time. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may temporarily eliminate the cost share amount 
that you must pay for certain covered services  such as your copayment  or your deductible  or your 
coinsurance . 
Charges for Non-Medically Necessary Services 
You may receive health care services that would otherwise be covered by this health plan, except that these 
services are not determined to be medically necessary  for you by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . This 
health plan does not cover health care services or supplies that are not medically necessary  for you. If you 
receive care that is not medically necessary  for you, you might be charged for the care by the health care 
provider. A provider who has a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has agreed not 
to charge you for services that are not medically necessary , unless you were told, knew, or reasonably 
should have known before you received this treatment that it was not medically necessary . 
Clinical Guidelines and Utilization Review Criteria 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue applies medical technology assessment criteria and medical necessity 
guidelines when it develops its clinical guidelines, utilization review criteria, and medical policies. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue reviews its clinical guidelines, utilization review criteria, and medical policies 
from time to time. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue does this to reflect new treatments, applications, and 
technologies. For example, when a new drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue reviews its safety, effectiveness, and overall value on an ongoing basis. 
While a new treatment, technology, or drug is being reviewed, it will not be covered by this health plan. 
Another example is when services and supplies are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the diagnosis and treatment of insulin dependent, insulin using, gestational, or non-insulin 
dependent diabetes. In this case, coverage will be provided for those services or supplies as long as they 
can be classified under a category of covered services. 
Continuity of Care Access for Cancer and Pediatric Facilities 
When you enroll in a limited or  tiered network plan under a group contract  and your group is a small 
employer group , you may be eligible for continuity of care coverage if you are receiving an active course Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 81 of care for a serious illness that you began before your effective date  in the limited or tiered network plan. 
To be eligible for this continuity of care coverage, you must meet all of the following conditions: 
 You began an active course of care for a serious illness (such as cancer or cystic fibrosis) at a 
comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility  on or after May 1, 2012 but before your effective date  in 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  limited or tiered network plan. A “comprehensive cancer or 
pediatric facility” means: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston Children’s Hospital, Shriners 
Hospitals for Children (Boston and Springfield), Nashoba Valley Medical Center, and Massachusetts 
Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
 The comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility is not in the health plan’s network; or, for a tiered 
network plan, you would normally pay the highest cost share amount for covered services  furnished 
at the comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility where you are receiving your care. 
 Your active course of care, if it were disrupted, would cause you an undue hardship. This means, for 
example, a disruption could endanger your life, or cause you suffering or pain, or result in a 
substantial change to your treatment plan.  
If you meet all of the conditions stated above, you are eligible for this coverage until the end of the 12-month 
period that starts on the subscriber’s effective date  in the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  limited or 
tiered network plan, but only when  your group offers you a choice to enroll only in a limited or tiered 
network plan in which your comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility either is not part of the health plan’s 
network or, for a tiered network plan, it is at the highest cost share level; and your care is not available from 
another provider in the health plan’s network. If you think you are eligible for this coverage, you or your 
health care provider must send a completed continuity of care form to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
You can get a copy of this form by calling customer service at the toll free phone number that is shown on 
your ID card. Or, you can log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at 
www.bluecrossma.org . Just follow the steps to request a form. 
If you are enrolled in a limited network plan and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines you are 
eligible for this coverage, your cost share amount for covered services  will be the same that would apply to 
a comparable network provider. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines you are not eligible for 
this coverage, no benefits will be provided. 
If you are enrolled in a tiered network plan and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines you are 
eligible for this coverage, your cost share amount will be at the second highest cost share level when the 
comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility is at the highest cost share level. Or, your cost share amount will 
be at the lowest cost share level when the comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility is not part of the health 
plan’s network. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines you are not eligible for this coverage, you 
must pay the cost share amount you would normally pay for covered services  furnished at a comprehensive 
cancer or pediatric facility. 
Disagreement with Recommended Treatment 
When you enroll for coverage in this health plan, you agree that it is up to your health care provider to 
decide the right treatment for your care. You may (for personal or religious reasons) refuse to accept the 
procedures or treatments that are advised by your health care provider. Or, you may ask for treatment that 
a health care provider judges does not meet generally accepted standards of professional medical care. You 
have the right to refuse the treatment advice of the health care provider. Or, you have the right to seek other 
care at your own expense. If you want a second opinion about your care, you have the right to coverage for 
second and third opinions. (See Part 5.) Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 82 Mandates for Residents or Services Outside of Massachusetts 
When you live or receive health care services or supplies in a state other than Massachusetts, your coverage 
and other requirements for health care services you receive in that state may be different from those 
described in this Subscriber Certificate. In this case, you may be entitled to receive additional coverage 
under this health plan as required by that state’s law. You should call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
customer service office for more help if this applies to you. 
Member Cooperation 
You agree to provide Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  with information it needs to comply with federal 
and/or state law and regulation. If you do not do so in a timely manner, your claims may be denied and/or 
your coverage in this health plan may be affected. 
Pre-Existing Conditions 
Your coverage in this health plan is not limited based on medical conditions that are present on or 
before your effective date . This means that your health care services will be covered from the effective 
date of your coverage in this health plan without a pre-existing condition restriction or a waiting period. 
But, benefits for these health care services are subject to all the provisions of this health plan. 
Quality Assurance Programs 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses quality assurance programs. These programs are designed to 
improve the quality of health care and the services that are provided to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
members. These programs affect different aspects of health care. This may include, for example, health 
promotion. From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may add or change the programs that it 
uses. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will do this to ensure that it continues to provide you and your 
family with access to high-quality health care and services. For more information, you can call the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The toll free phone number to call is shown on your 
ID card. Some of the clinical programs that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses are: 
 A breast cancer screening program. It encourages female members who are over 50 to have 
mammograms. 
 A cervical cancer screening program. It helps to get more female members who are age 18 and older 
to have a Pap smear test. 
 A program that furnishes outreach and education to pregnant members. It adds to the care that the 
member gets from an obstetrician or nurse midwife. 
 A program that promotes timely postnatal checkups. 
 Diabetes management and education. This helps diabetic members to self-manage their diabetes. It 
also helps to identify high-risk members and helps to assess their ongoing needs. 
 Congestive heart failure disease management, education, and monitoring. 
Services Furnished by Non-Participating Providers 
By enrolling in this health plan, you have agreed to receive all of your health care services and supplies 
from health care providers who participate in your health care network. But, there are a few times when 
this health plan will provide coverage for covered services  that you receive from a health care provider who 
does not participate in your health care network. These times are described below in this section. If you 
receive covered services  from a covered health care provider who does not participate in your health care 
network, you will receive coverage from this health plan only when : 
 You receive emergency medical care . Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 83  You receive urgent care  outside of your service area . 
 You receive services to diagnose or treat the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). See Part 5, 
“COVID-19 Testing and Treatment” for your coverage for these services. 
 Your condition requires covered services  that cannot be furnished by a health care provider who 
participates in your health care network and your primary care provider  refers you to a health care 
provider who does not participate in your health care network for the covered services . In addition to 
your primary care provider ’s referral, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  must approve the referral in 
writing before you receive the services. You should not obtain any services from a health care 
provider who does not participate in your health care network until you check with your primary care 
provider or with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
 You receive medically necessary covered services  while you are at a network hospital or other 
covered facility and you do not have a reasonable opportunity to choose to have your covered 
services furnished by a network provider . For example, you receive  covered services  from a 
non-network hospital-based anesthetist, pathologist, or radiologist while you are at a network 
hospital. 
 You receive certain covered services  that are protected from surprise billing as described in Part 2. 
(See “Allowed Charge” for more information.) 
 You are a newly enrolled group member who is having an ongoing course of treatment from a 
physician (or a primary care provider that is a nurse practitioner or physician assistant) who does not 
participate in your health care network, and your group only offers its employees a choice of health 
insurance plans in which your physician (or your primary care provider that is a nurse practitioner or 
physician assistant) does not participate as a covered provider . In this case, this health plan will 
provide coverage for covered services  you get from that health care provider up to 30 days from your 
effective date  or, for a member who is in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, up through the 
first post-partum visit or, for a member with a terminal illness, until the member’s  death. (For a 
member with a terminal illness, this coverage is provided only when the member is expected to live 
six months or less as determined by a physician.) 
When Your Provider Disenrolls (or is Involuntarily Disenrolled) From the Network 
If your provider disenrolls from the network for a reason other than a quality-related reason or fraud, this 
health plan will provide coverage for covered services  that you receive from a health care provider who 
does not participate in your health care network. As required by law, this continuity of care coverage is 
described below in this section. If you receive covered services  from a covered health care provider who 
does not participate in your health care network, you may receive coverage from this health plan only when : 
 Your primary care provider  disenrolls from your health care network. In this case, this health plan 
will provide coverage for covered services  you continue to receive from that health care provider for 
up to 30 days after the provider disenrolls from your health care network. 
 Your provider disenrolls from your health care network and you are a member who is receiving 
covered services  for the situations listed below. If this is the case, this health plan will notify you  that 
the health care provider is no longer part of the health care network. 
 You are undergoing a course of treatment for a serious and complex condition; you are 
undergoing a course of institutional or inpatient care; or you are scheduled to undergo 
non-elective surgery (including postoperative care). This health plan will also notify you  of your 
right to request to continue to have benefits provided for covered services  from that health care 
provider for up to 90 days after the provider disenrolls from your health care network or when the 
course of treatment is completed, whichever comes first. 
 You are pregnant and undergoing a course of treatment for the pregnancy. This health plan will 
also notify you  of your right to request to continue to have benefits provided for covered services  Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 84 from that health care provider for up to 90 days after the provider disenrolls from your health care 
network or  through your first post-partum visit, whichever is longer. 
 You are determined to be terminally ill. This health plan will also notify you  of your right to 
request to continue to have benefits provided for covered services  from that health care provider 
for as long as the covered services  are needed. 
 Your provider is involuntarily disenrolled from your health care network and you are a member who 
is in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. In this case, this health plan will provide coverage for 
covered services you get from that health care provider for your pregnancy up through the first 
post-partum visit. 
 Your provider  is involuntarily disenrolled from your health care network and you are a member with 
a terminal illness. In this case, this health plan will provide coverage for covered services you get 
from that health care provider for the terminal illness. (This coverage is continued only when the 
terminally ill member is expected to live six months or less as determined by a physician.) 
Services in a Disaster 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not liable if events beyond its control—such as war, riot, national 
emergency, terrorist attack, public health emergency, pandemic, or natural disaster—cause delay or failure 
of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to arrange for or coordinate access to health care services and coverage 
for its members. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a good faith effort to arrange for or to 
coordinate health care services to be furnished in these situations. 
There may be times when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  provides coverage for services and/or supplies 
due to events beyond its control that are not described in this Subscriber Certificate. (See “Changes to 
Health Plan Coverage” in this Part 8 for more information.) 
Time Limit for Legal Action 
Before you pursue a legal action against Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for any claim under this health 
plan, you must complete the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internal formal review. (See Part 10.) You 
may, but you do not need to, complete an external review before you pursue a legal action. If, after you 
complete the formal review, you choose to bring a legal action against Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , 
you must bring this action within two years after the cause of the action arises. For example, if you are 
filing a legal action because you were denied a service or you were denied a claim for coverage from this 
health plan, you will lose your right to bring a legal action against Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  unless 
you file your action within two years after the date of the decision of the final internal appeal of the service 
or claim denial.

 Page 85 Part 9  
Filing a Claim 
When the Provider Files a Claim 
The health care provider will file a claim for you when you receive a covered service  from a covered 
provider or, for covered services  you receive outside of Massachusetts, from a health care provider who 
has a payment agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. Just tell the health care provider 
that you are a member and show the health care provider your ID card. Also, be sure to give the health care 
provider any other information that is needed to file your claim. You must properly inform your health care 
provider within 30 days after you receive the covered service . If you do not, coverage will not have to be 
provided. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will pay the health care provider directly for covered services  
when the provider has a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue or with the local Blue 
Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. (When you are outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center has arranged your inpatient admission, 
the hospital should file the claim for you. In this case, the hospital will usually bill you only for your 
deductible  and/or your copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. But, if you paid the 
hospital’s actual charge in full at the time of the service, you must submit a claim as described in the section 
below.) 
When the Member Files a Claim 
You may have to file your claim when you receive a covered service  from a health care provider who does 
not have a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or a health care provider outside of 
Massachusetts who does not have a payment agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. 
The health care provider may ask you to pay the entire charge at the time of the visit or at a later time. It is 
up to you to pay your health care provider. To file a claim to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for 
repayment, you must: 
 Fill out a claim form; 
 Attach your original itemized bills; and 
 Mail the claim to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. 
You can get claim forms from the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. (See Part 1.) 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will mail to you all forms that you will need within 15 days after 
receiving notice that you obtained some service or supply for which you may be paid. 
When you receive covered services  outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, you 
must file your claim to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center. (The Blue Cross Blue

 Page 86 Timeliness of Claim Payments 
Within 30 calendar days after Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  receives a completed request for coverage 
or payment, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision. When appropriate, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will make a payment to the health care provider (or to you in certain situations) for your 
claim to the extent of your coverage in this health plan. Or, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send 
you and/or the health care provider a notice in writing of why your claim is not being paid in full or in part. 
Missing Information 
If the request for coverage or payment is not complete or if Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  needs more 
information to make a final determination for your claim, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for 
the information or records it needs. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this request within 
30 calendar days of the date that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  received the request for coverage or 
payment. This additional information must be provided to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within 
45 calendar days of this request. 
 Missing Information Received Within 45 Days.  If the additional information is provided to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within 45 calendar days of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  request, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision within the time remaining in the original 
30-day claim determination period. Or, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make the decision 
within 15 calendar days of the date that the additional information is received by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue , whichever is later. 
 Missing Information Not Received Within 45 Days.  If the additional information is not provided to 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within 45 calendar days of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  
request, the claim for coverage or payment will be denied by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . If 
the additional information is submitted to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  after these 45 days, then 
it may be viewed by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as a new claim for coverage or payment. In 
this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision within 30 days as described 
previously in this section.

 Page 87 Part 10  
Appeal and Grievance Program 
You have the right to a full and fair review when you disagree with a decision that is made by Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  to deny a request for coverage or payment for services; or you disagree with how 
your claim was paid; or you are denied coverage in this health plan; or your coverage is canceled or 
discontinued by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for reasons other than nonpayment of premium. You 
also have the right to a full and fair review when you have a complaint about the care or service you received 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from a provider who participates in your health care network. 
Part 10 explains the process for handling these types of problems and concerns. 
When making a determination under this health plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has full 
discretionary authority to interpret this Subscriber Certificate and to determine whether a health service or 
supply is a covered service  under this health plan. All determinations by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
with respect to benefits under this health plan will be conclusive and binding unless it can be shown that 
the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious. 
Inquiries and/or Claim Problems or Concerns 
Most problems or concerns can be handled with just one phone call. For help to resolve a problem or 
concern, you should first call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The toll free 
phone number to call is shown on your ID card. A customer service representative will work with you to 
help you understand your coverage or to resolve your problem or concern as quickly as possible. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will consider all aspects of the particular case when resolving a problem 
or concern. This includes looking at: all of the provisions of this health plan; the policies and procedures 
that support this health plan; the health care provider’s input; and your understanding of coverage by this 
health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may use an individual consideration approach when Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  judges it to be appropriate. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will follow its 
standard guidelines when it resolves your problem or concern. 
If after speaking with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service representative, you still 
disagree with a decision that is given to you, you may request a formal review through the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  Member Appeal and Grievance Program. You may also request a formal review if Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has not responded to you within three working days of receiving your inquiry. 
If this does happen, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you and let you know the steps you may 
follow to request a formal review. 
Appeal and Grievance Review Process 
Internal Formal Review 
How to Request an Internal Formal Appeal or Grievance Review 
To request an internal formal appeal or grievance  review, you (or your authorized or legal representative) 
have three options: 
 To write or send a fax.  The preferred option is for you to send your request for an appeal or a 
grievance  review in writing to: Member Appeal and Grievance Program, Blue Cross Blue Shield Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 88 of Massachusetts, One Enterprise Drive, Quincy, MA 02171-2126 . Or, you may fax your request 
to 1-617-246-3616. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know that your request was 
received by sending you a written confirmation within 15 calendar days. When you send your request, 
you should be sure to include any documentation that will help the review. 
 To send an e-mail.  You may send your request for an appeal or a grievance  review to the Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  Member Appeal and Grievance Program e-mail address 
grievances@bcbsma.com . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know that your request 
was received by sending you a confirmation immediately by e-mail. When you send your request, you 
should be sure to include any documentation that will help the review. 
 To make a telephone call. You may call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Member Appeal and 
Grievance Program at 1-800-472-2689 . When your request is made by phone, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will send you a written account of your request for an appeal or a grievance  review within 
48 hours of your phone call. 
Before you make an appeal or file a grievance , you should read “What to Include in an Appeal or Grievance 
Review Request” that shows later in this section. 
Once your appeal or grievance  request is received, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will research the 
case in detail. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for more information if it is needed and let you 
know in writing of the review decision or the outcome of the review. If your request for a review is about 
termination of your coverage for concurrent services that were previously approved by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue , the disputed coverage will continue until this review process is completed. This 
continuation of your coverage does not apply to services: that are limited by a day, dollar, or visit benefit 
limit and that exceed the benefit limit ; that are non- covered services ; or that were received prior to the time 
you requested the formal review. It also does not apply if your request for a review was not received on a 
timely basis, based on the course of the treatment. 
All requests for an appeal or a grievance  review must be received by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
within 180 calendar days of the date of treatment, event, or circumstance which is the cause of your dispute 
or complaint, such as the date you were told of the service denial or claim denial. 
Office of Patient Protection 
The Massachusetts Office of Patient Protection can help members with information and reports about health 
plan appeals and complaints. To contact that office, you can call 1-800-436-7757 . Or, you can fax a request 
to 1-617-624-5046 . Or, you can go online and log on to the Office of Patient Protection’s Web site at 
www.mass.gov/hpc/opp . 
What to Include in an Appeal or Grievance Review Request 
Your request for an internal formal appeal or grievance  review should include: the name, ID number, and 
daytime phone number of the member asking for the review; a description of the problem; all relevant dates; 
names of health care providers or administrative staff involved; and details of the attempt that has been 
made to resolve the problem. 
 Appealing a Coverage Decision.  A “coverage decision” is a decision that Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  makes about your coverage or about the amount Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
pay for your health care services or drugs. For example, your doctor may have to contact Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  and ask for a coverage decision before you receive proposed services. Or, a 
coverage decision is made when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decides what is covered and how Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 89 much you will pay for services you have already received. In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  might decide a service or drug is not covered or is no longer covered for you. You can 
make an appeal if you disagree with a coverage decision made by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
When you make an appeal about a medical necessity  coverage decision, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue will review your health plan contract and the policies and procedures that are in effect for your 
appeal along with medical treatment information that will help in the review. Some examples of the 
medical information that will help Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  review your appeal may 
include: medical records related to your appeal, provider consultation and office notes, and related 
lab or other test results. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  needs to review your medical records 
and you have not provided your consent, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will promptly send you 
an authorization form to sign. You must return this signed form to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
It will allow for the release of your medical records. You have the right to look at and get copies (free 
of charge) of records and criteria that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has and that are relevant to 
your appeal, including the identity of any experts who were consulted. 
If you disagree with how your claim was paid or you are denied coverage for a specific health care 
service or drug, you can make an appeal about the coverage decision. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue will review the health plan contract that is in effect for your appeal to see if all of the rules were 
properly followed and to see if the service or drug is specifically excluded or limited by your health 
plan. The appeal decision will be based on the terms of your health plan contract. For example, if a 
service is excluded or limited by your health plan contract, no benefits can be provided even if the 
services are medically necessary  for you. For this reason, you should be sure to review all parts of 
your health plan contract for any coverage limits and exclusions. These parts include your Subscriber 
Certificate and Schedule of Benefits  and riders (if there are any) that apply for your health plan 
contract. 
 Filing a Grievance.  You can file a grievance  when you have a complaint about the care or service 
you received from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from a health care provider who participates 
in your health care network. Some examples of these types of problems are: you are unhappy with the 
quality of the care you have received; you are having trouble getting an appointment or waiting too 
long to get care; or you are unhappy with how the customer service representative has treated you. If 
you submit a formal grievance  about the quality of care you received from a Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will contact you to obtain your permission to 
contact the provider (if your permission is not included in your formal grievance ). For this type of 
grievance , Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will investigate the grievance  with your permission, but 
the results of any provider peer review are confidential. For this reason, you will not receive the 
results of this type of investigation. 
Choosing an Authorized Representative 
You may choose to have another person act on your behalf during the appeal or grievance  review process. 
Except as described below, you must designate this person in writing to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
If your claim is for urgent care  or emergency medical care services, a health care professional who has 
knowledge about your medical condition may act as your authorized representative. In this case, you do not 
have to designate the health care professional in writing. If you are not able to designate another person to 
act on your behalf, then a conservator, a person with power of attorney, or a family member may act as 
your authorized representative. Or, they may appoint someone else to act as your authorized representative. Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 90 Who Handles the Appeal or Grievance Review 
All appeals and grievances  are reviewed by professionals who are knowledgeable about Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  and the issues involved in the appeal or grievance . The professionals who will review 
your appeal or grievance  will be different from those who participated in Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue’s prior decision regarding the subject of your appeal or grievance , nor will they work for anyone who 
did. When a review is related to a medical necessity  denial, at least one reviewer will be an individual who 
is an actively practicing health care professional in the same or similar specialty who usually treats the 
medical condition or performs the procedure or provides treatment that is the subject of your review. 
Response Time for an Appeal or Grievance Review 
The review and response for an internal formal appeal or grievance  review will be completed within 
30 calendar days. Every reasonable effort will be made to speed up the review for requests that involve 
health care services that are soon to be obtained by the member. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may extend the 30-calendar-day time frame to complete a review when 
both Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and the member agree that additional time is required to fully 
investigate and respond to the request. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also extend the 
30-calendar-day time frame when the review requires your medical records and Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  needs your authorization to get these records. The 30-day response time will not include the 
days from when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  sends you the authorization form to sign until it receives 
your signed authorization form. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  does not receive your authorization 
within 30 working days after your request for a review is received, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may 
make a final decision about your request without that medical information. In any case, for a review 
involving services that have not yet been obtained by you, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for 
your permission to extend the 30-day time frame if it cannot complete the review within 30 calendar days 
of receipt of your request for a review. 
An appeal or grievance  that is not acted upon within the time frames specified by applicable federal or state 
law will be considered resolved in favor of the member. 
Important Note: If your appeal or grievance  review began after an inquiry, the 30-day response time will 
begin on the day you tell Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  that you disagree with Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue’s  answer and would like an internal formal review. 
Written Response for an Appeal or Grievance Review 
Once the review is completed, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know in writing of the 
decision or the outcome of the review. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  continues to deny coverage for 
all or part of a health care service or supply, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send an explanation to 
you. This notice will include: information related to the details of your appeal or grievance ; the reasons 
that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has denied the request and the applicable terms of your coverage in 
this health plan; the specific medical and scientific reasons for which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
has denied the request; any alternative treatment or health care services and supplies that would be covered; 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  clinical guidelines that apply and were used and any review criteria; and 
how to request an external review. 
Appeal and Grievance Review Records 
You have the right to look at and get copies of records and criteria that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
has and that are relevant to your appeal or grievance . These copies will be free of charge.  Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will maintain a record of all formal appeals and grievances , including the response for 
each review, for up to seven years. Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 91 Expedited Review for Immediate or Urgently-Needed Services 
In place of the internal formal review as described above in this section, you have the right to request an 
“expedited” review right away when your situation is for immediate or urgently-needed services. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will respond to formal requests for a review for immediate or urgently-needed 
services as follows: 
 When your request for a review concerns medical care or treatment for which waiting for a response 
under the review time frames described above would seriously jeopardize your life or health or your 
ability to regain maximum function as determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or your 
physician, or if your physician says that you will have severe pain that cannot be adequately managed 
without the care or treatment that is the subject of the review, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
review your request and notify you of the decision within 72 hours after your request is received, or 
such shorter time period as required by federal law. 
 When a formal review is requested while you are an inpatient, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
complete the review and make a decision regarding the request before you are discharged from that 
inpatient stay. 
 Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  decision to deny payment for health care services, including 
durable medical equipment, may be reversed within 48 hours if your attending physician certifies to 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  that a denial for those health care services would create a 
substantial risk of serious harm to you if you were to wait for the outcome of the normal formal 
review process. Your physician can also request the reversal of a denial for durable medical 
equipment earlier than 48 hours by providing more specific information to Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  about the immediate and severe harm to you. 
 A formal review requested by a member with a terminal illness will be completed by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  within five working days of receiving the request. In this case, if the expedited 
review results in a denial for health care services or treatment, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
send a letter to the member within five working days. This letter will include: information related to 
the details of the request for a review; the reasons that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has denied 
the request and the applicable terms of your coverage in this health plan; the specific medical and 
scientific reasons for which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has denied the request; any alternative 
treatment or health care services and supplies that would be covered; Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue clinical guidelines that apply and were used and any review criteria; and how to request a 
hearing. When the member requests a hearing, the hearing will be held within ten days. (Or, it will be 
held within five working days if the attending physician determines after consultation with Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s Medical Director and based on standard medical practice that the 
effectiveness of the health care service, supply, or treatment would be materially reduced if it were 
not furnished at the earliest possible date.) You and/or your authorized or legal representative(s) may 
attend this hearing. 
External Review 
You must first go through the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internal formal appeal and grievance  
review process as described above, unless Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has failed to comply with the 
time frames for the internal formal review or if you (or your authorized or legal representative) are 
requesting an expedited external review at the same time you (or your authorized or legal representative) 
are requesting an expedited internal review. The Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internal formal review 
decision may be to continue to deny all or part of your coverage in this health plan. When you are denied 
coverage for a service or supply because Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has determined that the service 
or supply is not medically necessary , you have the right to an external review. You are not required to 
pursue an external review. Your decision whether to pursue an external review will not affect your other 
coverage. If you receive a denial letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  in response to your internal 
formal review, the letter will tell you what steps you can take to file a request for an external review. The Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 92 external review will be conducted by a review agency under contract with the Massachusetts Office of 
Patient Protection. 
How to Request an External Review 
To obtain an external review, you must submit your request on the form required by the Office of Patient 
Protection. On this form, you (or your authorized or legal representative) must sign a consent to release 
your medical information for external review. Attached to the form, you must send a copy of the letter of 
denial that you received from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . In addition, you must send the fee required 
to pay for your portion of the cost of the review. The form, as well as the denial letter from Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue , will tell you about your fee. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will be charged the rest 
of the cost by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. (Your portion of the cost may be waived by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the case of extreme financial hardship.) If you decide to request an 
external review, you must file your request within the four months after you receive the denial letter 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
You (or your authorized or legal representative) also have the right to request an “expedited” external 
review. When requesting an expedited external review, you must include a written statement from a 
physician. This statement should explain that a delay in providing or continuing those health care services 
that have been denied for coverage would pose a serious and immediate threat to your health. Based on this 
information, the Office of Patient Protection will determine if you are eligible for an expedited external 
review. You (or your authorized or legal representative) also have the right to request an expedited external 
review at the same time that you file a request for an expedited internal formal review. 
If your request for a review is regarding termination of coverage for concurrent services that were 
previously approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , you may request approval to have the disputed 
coverage continue until the external review process is completed. To do this, you must make your request 
before the end of the second working day after your receipt of the denial letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue. The request may be approved if it is determined that not continuing these services may pose 
substantial harm to your health. In the event that coverage is approved to continue, you will not be charged 
for those health care services, regardless of the outcome of your review. This continuation of coverage does 
not apply to services: that are limited by a day, dollar, or visit benefit limit  and that exceed the benefit limit ; 
that are non -covered services ; or that were received prior to the time you requested the external review. 
To contact the Office of Patient Protection, you can call toll free at 1-800-436-7757 . Or, you can fax a 
request to 1-617-624-5046 . Or, you can go online and log on to the Office of Patient Protection’s Web site 
at www.mass.gov/hpc/opp . 
External Review Process 
The Office of Patient Protection will screen all requests for an external review. They will begin this 
screening within 48 hours of receiving a request for an expedited external review and within five business 
days for all other external review requests. The Office of Patient Protection will determine if your request 
for an external review: has been submitted as required by state regulation and described above; does not 
involve a service or benefit that is excluded by your health plan as explicitly stated in your health plan 
contract; and results from an adverse determination, except that no adverse determination is necessary when 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has failed to comply with the timelines for an internal appeal or 
grievance  review or if you (or your authorized or legal representative) are requesting an expedited external 
review at the same time you are requesting an expedited internal formal review. 
When your request is eligible for an external review, an external review agency will be selected and your 
case will be referred to them. You (or your authorized or legal representative) will be notified of the name 
of the review agency. This notice will also state whether or not your case is being reviewed on an expedited Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 93 basis. This notice will also be sent to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  along with a copy of your signed 
medical information release form. 
External Review Decisions and Notice 
The review agency will consider all aspects of the case and send a written response of the outcome. They 
will send the response to you (or your authorized or legal representative) and to Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  within 45 calendar days of receiving the referral from the Office of Patient Protection. In the 
case of an expedited review, you will be notified of their decision within 72 hours. This 72-hour period 
starts when the review agency receives your case from the Office of Patient Protection. 
If the review agency overturns Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  decision in whole or in part, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send you (or your authorized or legal representative) a notice within five 
working days of receiving the review decision made by the agency. This notice will confirm the decision 
of the review agency. It will also tell you: what steps or procedures you must take (if any) to obtain the 
requested coverage or services; the date by which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will pay for or 
authorize the requested services; and the name and phone number of the person at Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  who will make sure your appeal or grievance  is resolved. 
The decision made by way of the external review process will be accepted as final. 
You have the right to look at and get copies of records and criteria that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
has and that are relevant to your appeal or grievance . These copies will be free of charge.

 Page 94 Part 11  
Group Policy 
This part applies to you when you enroll in this health plan as a group member.  Under a group contract, 
the subscriber’s  group has an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide its group 
members with access to health care services and benefits. The group will make payments to Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  for its group members for coverage in this health plan. The group should also deliver 
to its group members all notices from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The group is the subscriber’s  
agent and is not the agent of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . For questions about enrollment and billing, 
you must contact the group (which may also be referred to as your plan sponsor ). The plan sponsor  is 
usually the subscriber’s  employer and is the same as the plan sponsor designated under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). If you are not sure who your plan sponsor  
is, contact your employer. 
Important Note: If you enrolled in this health plan through the Massachusetts Health Connector, your 
group has a contract with the Health Connector and not Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The group 
makes payments to the Health Connector for your coverage in this health plan. The Health Connector will 
send all notices to the subscriber . You must call the Health Connector directly for any questions about: 
your enrollment in this health plan; your premium payments; and any membership changes you need to 
make such as a change to your name or address. For any questions about your health plan coverage or your 
claims, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. 
Eligibility and Enrollment for Group Coverage 
Eligible Employee 
An employee is eligible to enroll in this health plan as a subscriber  under a group contract  as long as: 
 The employee meets the rules on length of service, active employment, and number of hours worked 
that the plan sponsor  has set to determine eligibility for group coverage. For details, contact your 
plan sponsor. 
 The employee resides in the service area  (or lives and/or works within a reasonable distance from the 
service area ). 
Eligible Spouse 
The subscriber  may enroll an eligible spouse for coverage in this health plan under their group contract. 
An “eligible spouse” includes the subscriber’s  legal spouse. (A legal civil union spouse, where applicable, 
is eligible to enroll for coverage in this health plan under the  group contract to the extent that a legal civil 
union spouse is determined eligible by the plan sponsor . For more details, contact your plan sponsor.) In 
order to enroll for coverage in this health plan, the eligible spouse must also reside in the service area  (or 
live within a reasonable distance from the service area ). 
Former Spouse 
In the event of a divorce or a legal separation, the person who was the spouse of the subscriber  prior to the 
divorce or legal separation will remain eligible for coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  group 
contract, whether or not the judgment was entered prior to the effective date  of the group contract. This 
health plan coverage is provided with no additional premium other than the normal cost of covering a 
current spouse. The former spouse will remain eligible for this coverage only  until the subscriber  is no 
longer required by the judgment to provide health insurance for the former spouse or the subscriber  or Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 95 former spouse remarries, whichever comes first. In these situations, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
must be notified within 30 days of a change to the former spouse’s address. Otherwise, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will not be liable for any acts or omissions due to having the former spouse’s incorrect 
address on file. 
If the subscriber  remarries, the former spouse may continue coverage in this health plan under a separate 
membership within the subscriber’s  group, provided the divorce judgment requires that the subscriber  
provide health insurance for the former spouse. This is true even if the subscriber’s  new spouse is not 
enrolled for coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  group contract. 
Eligible Dependents 
The subscriber  may enroll eligible dependents for coverage in this health plan under their group contract. 
“Eligible dependents” include the subscriber’s  (or subscriber’s  spouse’s) children until the end of the 
calendar month in which the child turns age 26. To be an eligible dependent, the child is not required to 
live with the subscriber  or the subscriber’s  spouse, be a dependent on the subscriber’s  or spouse’s tax 
return, or be a full-time student. However, to enroll for coverage in this health plan, all eligible dependents 
must reside in the service area  or, except for full-time students, live within a reasonable distance from the 
service area . These eligible dependents may include: 
 A newborn child. The effective date  of coverage for a newborn child will be the child’s date of birth 
provided that the subscriber  formally notifies the plan sponsor within 30 days of the date of birth. 
(A claim for a member’s  maternity admission may be considered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue to be this notice when the subscriber’s  coverage is a family plan.) This health plan provides 
coverage for newborn infants for injury and sickness. This includes the necessary care and treatment 
of medically diagnosed congenital defects, birth abnormalities, and premature birth. The coverage for 
these services is subject to all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 An adopted child. The effective date  of coverage for an adopted child will be the date of placement of 
the child with the subscriber  for the purpose of adoption. The effective date  of coverage for an 
adoptive child who has been living with the subscriber  and for whom the subscriber  has been getting 
foster care payments will be the date the petition to adopt is filed. If the subscriber  is enrolled under a 
family plan as of the date they assume custody of a child for the purpose of adoption, the child’s 
health care services for injury or sickness will be covered from the date of custody. (This coverage is 
provided without a waiting period or pre-existing condition restriction.) This includes the necessary 
care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects, birth abnormalities, and premature 
birth. The coverage for these services is subject to all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 A newborn infant of an enrolled dependent child immediately from the moment of birth and 
continuing after, until the enrolled dependent child is no longer eligible as a dependent. 
If an eligible dependent child is married, the dependent child can enroll for coverage under the subscriber’s 
group contract . And, as long as that enrolled child is an eligible dependent, their children are also eligible 
for coverage under the subscriber’s group contract . The dependent child’s spouse is not eligible to enroll 
as a dependent for coverage under the subscriber’s group contract . 
An eligible dependent may also include: 
 A person under age 26 who is not the subscriber’s  (or subscriber’s  spouse’s) child but who qualifies 
as a dependent of the subscriber  under the Internal Revenue Code. When the dependent loses their 
dependent status under the Internal Revenue Code, that dependent will continue to be eligible as a 
dependent for coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  group contract  for two years after 
the end of the calendar year in which they last qualified as a dependent under the Internal Revenue 
Code or until the dependent turns age 26, whichever comes first. Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 96  A child recognized under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order as having the right to enroll for 
health care coverage. 
 A disabled dependent child  age 26 or older. A dependent child who is mentally or physically 
incapable of earning their own living and who is enrolled under the subscriber’s group contract  will 
continue to be covered after they would otherwise lose dependent eligibility under the subscriber’s 
group contract , so long as the child continues to be mentally or physically incapable of earning their 
own living. In this case, the subscriber  must make arrangements with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue through the plan sponsor  not more than 30 days after the date the child would normally lose 
eligibility. Also, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  must be given any medical or other information 
that it may need to determine if the child can maintain coverage in this health plan under the 
subscriber’s  group contract. From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may conduct 
reviews that will require a statement from the attending physician. This is to confirm that the child is 
still an eligible disabled dependent child. 
In all of these cases, the child must reside in the service area  or, except for a full-time student, live within 
a reasonable distance from the service area . 
Important Reminder: The eligibility provisions for dependents that are described in this section may differ 
from the federal tax laws that define who may qualify as a dependent. 
Enrollment Periods for Group Coverage 
Initial Enrollment 
You may enroll for coverage in this health plan under a group contract on your initial group eligibility date. 
This date is determined by your plan sponsor . The plan sponsor  is responsible for providing you with 
details about how and when you may enroll for coverage in this health plan under a group contract. To 
enroll, you must complete the enrollment form provided by your plan sponsor  no later than 30 days after 
your eligibility date. (For more information, contact your plan sponsor .) If you choose not to enroll for 
coverage in this health plan under a group contract on your initial eligibility date, you may enroll under a 
group contract only during your group’s open enrollment period or within 30 days of a special enrollment 
event as provided by federal or Massachusetts law. 
Special Enrollment 
If an eligible employee or an eligible dependent (including the employee’s spouse) chooses not to enroll 
for coverage in this health plan under a group contract on their initial group eligibility date, federal or 
Massachusetts law may allow the eligible employee and/or their eligible dependents to enroll under the 
group contract when: 
 The employee and/or their eligible dependents have a loss of other coverage (see “Loss of Other 
Qualified Coverage” below for more information); or 
 The employee gains a new eligible dependent (see “New Dependents” below for more information); 
or 
 The employee and/or their eligible dependent become eligible for assistance under a Medicaid plan or 
a state Children’s Health Insurance Program plan. 
These rights are known as your “special enrollment rights.” There may be additional special enrollment 
rights as a result of changes required by federal law. For example, these changes may include special 
enrollment rights for: individuals who are newly eligible for coverage as a result of changes to dependent 
eligibility; and/or individuals who are newly eligible for coverage as a result of the elimination of a lifetime 
maximum. Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 97 Loss of Other Qualified Coverage 
An eligible employee may choose not to enroll themself or an eligible dependent (including a spouse) for 
coverage in this health plan under a group contract on the initial group eligibility date because they or the 
eligible dependent has other health plan coverage as defined by federal law. (This is referred to as 
“qualified” coverage.) In this case, the employee and the eligible dependent may enroll under the group 
contract if the employee or the eligible dependent at a later date loses that other qualified health plan 
coverage due to any one of the following reasons. 
 The employee or the eligible dependents (including a spouse) cease to be eligible for the other 
qualified health plan. For example, this could mean that the loss of the other qualified health plan was 
due to: the loss of the spouse’s coverage; the death of the spouse; divorce; loss of dependent status; or 
involuntary termination. This includes when an employee or eligible dependent is covered under a 
Medicaid plan or a state Children’s Health Insurance Program plan and coverage is terminated as a 
result of loss of eligibility for that coverage. 
 The employer that is sponsoring the other qualified group health plan coverage ceases to make 
employer contributions for the other group health plan coverage. 
 The employee or the eligible dependents (including a spouse) exhaust their continuation of group 
coverage under the other qualified group health plan. 
 The prior qualified health plan was terminated due to the insolvency of the health plan carrier. 
Important Note: You will not have this special enrollment right if the loss of other health plan coverage 
is a result of the eligible employee or the subscriber  or the eligible dependent’s failure to pay the applicable 
premiums. 
New Dependents 
If an eligible employee gains a new spouse or other new eligible dependent(s) due to marriage, adoption, 
placement for adoption, or birth, the employee and the spouse and/or the new dependent(s) may enroll for 
coverage in this health plan under a group contract. (If the new dependent is gained by birth, adoption, or 
placement for adoption, enrollment under the group contract will be retroactive to the date of birth or the 
date of adoption or the date of placement for adoption, provided that the enrollment time requirements 
described below are met.) 
Special Enrollment Time Requirement 
To exercise your special enrollment rights, you must notify your plan sponsor  no later than 30 days after 
the date when any one of the following situations occur: the date on which the loss of your other coverage 
occurs or the date on which the subscriber  gains a new dependent; or the date on which the subscriber  
receives notice that a dependent child who was not previously eligible is newly eligible for coverage as a 
result of changes to dependent eligibility; or the date on which you receive notice that you are newly eligible 
for coverage as a result of the elimination of a lifetime maximum. For example, if your coverage under 
another health plan is terminated, you must request enrollment for coverage in this health plan under a 
group contract within 30 days after your other health care coverage ends. Upon request, the plan sponsor  
will send you any special forms you may need. If you do not request enrollment within 30 days, you will 
have to wait until the group’s next open enrollment period to enroll under a group contract . You also have 
special enrollment rights related to termination of coverage under a state Children’s Health Insurance 
Program plan or a Medicaid plan or eligibility for assistance under a Medicaid plan or a state Children’s 
Health Insurance Program plan. When this situation applies, you must notify your plan sponsor  to request 
coverage no later than 60 days after the coverage terminates or the employee or eligible dependent is 
determined to be eligible for assistance. Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 98 Qualified Medical Child Support Order 
If the subscriber  chooses not to enroll an eligible dependent for coverage in this health plan under a group 
contract on the initial group eligibility date, the subscriber  may be required by law to enroll the dependent 
if the subscriber  is subject to a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO). This QMCSO order is 
a state court or administrative agency order that requires an employer’s group to provide coverage to the 
child of an employee who is covered, or eligible to enroll for group coverage, in this health plan. 
Open Enrollment Period 
If you choose not to enroll for coverage in this health plan under a group contract within 30 days of your 
initial group eligibility date, you may enroll during your group’s open enrollment period. The open 
enrollment period is the time each year during which eligible persons may enroll for or change coverage 
for the next year. The open enrollment period is announced by the group to all eligible employees. To enroll 
for coverage in this health plan under a group contract during this enrollment period, you must complete 
the enrollment form provided in the group’s enrollment packet and return it to the group no later than the 
date specified in the group’s enrollment packet. 
Other Membership Changes 
Generally, the subscriber  may make membership changes (for example, change from a subscriber  only 
plan to a family plan) only if the subscriber  has a change in family status. This includes a change such as: 
marriage or divorce; birth, adoption, or change in custody of a child; death of an enrolled spouse or 
dependent; or the loss of an enrolled dependent’s eligibility under the subscriber’s group contract . If you 
want to ask for a membership change or you need to change your name or mailing address, you 
should call or write to your plan sponsor . The plan sponsor  will send you any special forms that you may 
need. You must request the change within the time period required by the subscriber’s group  to make a 
change. If you do not make the change within the required time period, you will have to wait until the 
group’s next open enrollment period to make the change. All changes are allowed only when they comply 
with the eligibility and enrollment rules set by the plan sponsor  for your group coverage. They must also 
comply with the conditions outlined in the group contract and in the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
Manual of Underwriting Guidelines for Group Business. (If you enrolled in this health plan through the 
Massachusetts Health Connector, changes must comply with the Health Connector’s policies. If this applies 
to you, you must call the Health Connector directly for any questions about any membership changes you 
need to make such as a change to your name or address.) 
Termination of Group Coverage 
Loss of Eligibility for Group Coverage 
When your eligibility for a group contract ends, your coverage in this health plan under the group contract  
will be terminated as of the date you lose eligibility (subject to the continuation of coverage provisions 
described on page 101). You will not be eligible for coverage in this health plan under a group contract 
when any one of the following situations occurs. 
 Subscriber’s Group Eligibility Ends. Your coverage in this health plan under a group contract  will 
end when the subscriber  loses eligibility for the group’s health care coverage. This means: the 
subscriber’s  hours are reduced; or the subscriber  leaves the job; or the subscriber  no longer meets the 
rules that are set by the group for coverage under the group contract. (You will also lose eligibility 
for group coverage if you are an enrolled dependent when the subscriber  dies.) 
 Your Dependent Status Ends.  Your coverage in this health plan under a group contract  will end 
when you lose your status as a dependent under the subscriber’s  group contract . In this case, you may 
wish to enroll as a subscriber  under an individual contract . Or, you may be able to enroll in another Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 99 Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  health plan or a health plan offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
of Massachusetts, Inc. For help, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service 
office. They will tell you which health plans are available to you. 
 You Move Out of Your Service Area.  Your coverage in this health plan under a group contract  will 
end when you move permanently out of your service area . In this case, if you are still eligible for 
group coverage, you may be eligible to transfer your coverage to another health plan that is offered 
by your group. (Contact your plan sponsor for help.) Or, if you are not eligible for group coverage, 
you may be able to enroll in another Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan’s HMO plan. For help, you 
can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. They will help you with your 
options. 
 You Turn Age 65 and Become Eligible for Medicare.  Your coverage in this health plan under a 
group contract  will end when you reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare (Part A and Part B). 
However, as allowed by federal law, the subscriber  (and the spouse and/or dependents) may have the 
option of continuing coverage in this health plan under a group contract  when the subscriber  remains 
as an actively working employee after reaching age 65. You should review all options available to 
you with the plan sponsor . (Medicare eligible subscribers  who retire and/or their spouses are not 
eligible to continue coverage in this health plan under a group contract once they reach age 65.) 
 Your Group Fails to Pay Premiums.  Your coverage in this health plan under a group contract  will 
end when the plan sponsor fails to pay the group premium to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
within 30 days of the due date . In this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you in 
writing of the termination of your group coverage in accordance with the Code of Massachusetts 
Regulations. This notice will give you information about the termination of your group coverage and 
your options for coverage offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (If you enrolled in this health plan through the Massachusetts Health 
Connector, the group makes payments to the Health Connector. The Health Connector will send all 
notices to the subscriber  related to non-payment of your premium and termination.) 
 Your Group Cancels (or Does Not Renew) the Group Contract.  Your coverage in this health plan 
under a group contract  will end when  the group terminates (or does not renew) the group contract. 
Termination of Group Coverage by the Subscriber 
Your coverage in this health plan under a group contract will end when the subscriber  chooses to cancel 
their group contract as permitted by the plan sponsor . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  must receive the 
termination request not more than 30 days after the subscriber’s  termination date. 
Termination of Group Coverage by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
Your coverage in this health plan under a group contract will not be canceled because you are using your 
coverage or because you will need more covered services  in the future. In the event that Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  cancels your coverage in this health plan under a group contract , a notice will be sent to 
your group that will tell your group the specific reason(s) that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is 
canceling the group contract. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will cancel your coverage in this health 
plan under a group contract only when  one of the following situations occurs. 
 You Commit Misrepresentation or Fraud.  Your coverage in this health plan will be canceled, or in 
some cases Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may limit your benefits, if you have committed 
misrepresentation or fraud. For example, you gave false or misleading information on the enrollment 
form. Or, you misused your ID card by letting another person who was not enrolled in this health plan Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 100 attempt to get coverage. Your coverage in this health plan may be terminated when the fraud or 
misrepresentation is discovered or, as permitted by law, back to your effective date  or the date of the 
misrepresentation or fraud. Your coverage in this health plan may be terminated retroactive to a date 
in the past (rather than on a current or future date) only if you committed fraud or made an intentional 
misrepresentation of a material fact. The termination date will be determined by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue . 
 You Commit Acts of Physical or Verbal Abuse.  Your coverage in this health plan will be canceled 
if you commit acts of physical or verbal abuse that pose a threat to, or a threat to the health of, health 
care providers or other members or employees of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., and these acts are not related to your physical condition or 
mental condition . In this case, this termination will follow the procedures that have been approved by 
the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance. 
 You Fail to Comply with Plan Provisions.  Your coverage in this health plan will be canceled if you 
fail to comply in a material way with any provision of the group contract . For example, if you fail to 
provide information that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  requests related to your coverage in this 
health plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may terminate your coverage. 
 This Health Plan Is Discontinued. Your coverage in this health plan will be canceled if Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  discontinues this health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may 
discontinue this health plan for any reason as of a date approved by the Massachusetts Commissioner 
of Insurance. 
Continuation of Group Coverage 
Family and Medical Leave Act 
An employee may continue coverage in this health plan under a group contract as provided by the Family 
and Medical Leave Act. The Family and Medical Leave Act will generally apply to you if your group has 
50 or more employees. For more information, contact your plan sponsor. If the employee chooses to 
continue group coverage during a qualifying leave, the employee will be given the same health care benefits 
that would have been provided if the employee were working, with the same premium contribution ratio. If 
the employee’s premium for continued coverage under the group contract is more than 30 days late, the 
plan sponsor  will send written notice to the employee. It will tell the employee that their coverage will be 
terminated. It will also give the date of the termination if payment is not received by that date. This notice 
will be mailed at least 15 days before the termination date. 
If coverage in this health plan under the group contract is discontinued due to non-payment of premium, 
the employee’s coverage will be restored when they return to work to the same level of benefits as those 
the employee would have had if the leave had not been taken and the premium payment(s) had not been 
missed. This includes coverage for eligible dependents. The employee will not be required to meet any 
qualification requirements imposed by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  when they return to work. This 
includes: new or additional waiting periods; waiting for an open enrollment period; or passing a medical 
exam to reinstate coverage. You should contact your plan sponsor  with any questions that you may have 
about your coverage during a leave of absence. 
Limited Extension of Group Coverage under State Law 
If you lose eligibility for coverage in this health plan under a group contract  due to a plant closing or a 
partial plant closing (as defined by law) in Massachusetts, you may continue coverage under the group 
contract as provided by state law. If this happens to you, you and your group will each pay your shares of Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 101 the premium cost for up to 90 days after the plant closing. Then, to continue your group coverage for up to 
39 more weeks, you will pay 100% of the premium cost. At this same time, you may also be eligible for 
continued group coverage under other state laws or under federal law (see below). If you are, the starting 
date for continued group coverage under all of these laws will be the same date. But, after the 90-day 
extension period provided by this state law ends, you may have to pay more premium to continue your 
coverage under the group contract. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer sponsored 
health plan at any time before the 39-week extension period ends, continued coverage in this health plan 
under the group contract under these provisions also ends. 
Continuation of Group Coverage under Federal or State Law 
When you are no longer eligible for coverage in this health plan under a group contract, you may be eligible 
to continue group coverage as provided by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 
(COBRA) or under Massachusetts state law. (These provisions apply to you if your group has two or more 
employees.) To continue this group coverage, you may be required to pay up to 102% of the premium cost. 
These laws apply to you if you lose eligibility for coverage due to one of the following reasons. 
 Termination of employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct). 
 Reduction of work hours. 
 Divorce or legal separation. (In the event of divorce or legal separation, a spouse is eligible to keep 
coverage in this health plan under the employee’s group contract. This is the case only until the 
employee is no longer required by law to provide health insurance for the former spouse or the 
employee or former spouse remarries, whichever comes first. The former spouse’s eligibility for 
continued group coverage will start on the date of divorce, even if they continue coverage under the 
employee’s group contract. While the former spouse continues coverage under the employee’s group 
contract, there is no additional premium. After remarriage, under state and federal law, the former 
spouse may be eligible to continue group coverage in this health plan under a separate group contract 
for additional premium.) 
 Death of the subscriber . 
 Subscriber’s  entitlement to Medicare benefits. 
 Loss of status as an eligible dependent. 
The period of this continued group coverage begins with the date of your qualifying event. And, the length 
of this continued group coverage will be up to 36 months from that qualifying event. This is true except for 
termination of employment or reduction of work hours, in which cases continued group coverage is 
available for only 18 months or, if you are qualified for disability under Title II or Title XVI of the Social 
Security Act, up to 29 months. (See below for more information about continued coverage for disabled 
employees.) You should contact your plan sponsor  for more help about continued coverage. 
Important Note: When a subscriber’s  legal same-sex spouse is no longer eligible for coverage under the 
group contract, that spouse (or if it applies, that civil union spouse) and their dependents may continue 
coverage in the subscriber’s  group to the same extent that a legal opposite-sex spouse (and their dependents) 
could continue coverage upon loss of eligibility for coverage under the group contract. 
Additional Continued Coverage for Disabled Employees 
At the time of the employee’s termination of employment or reduction in hours (or within 60 days of the 
qualifying event under federal law), if an employee or their eligible dependent is determined to be disabled 
under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act, continued group coverage will be available for up to 
29 months from the date of the qualifying event. The premium cost for the additional 11 months may be up 
to 150% of the premium rate. If during these 11 months eligibility for disability is lost, group coverage may 
cancel before the 29 months is completed. You should contact your plan sponsor  for more help about 
continued coverage. Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 102 Special Rules for Retired Employees 
A retired employee, the spouse, and/or eligible dependent children of a retired employee or a surviving 
spouse of a retired deceased employee who loses eligibility for coverage in this health plan under the group 
contract as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding (Title 11 of the United States Code) is also eligible to 
continue group coverage as provided by COBRA or under Massachusetts state law. A retired employee 
and/or the surviving spouse of a deceased retired employee may enroll for lifetime continued group 
coverage as of the date of the bankruptcy proceeding, provided that the loss of group eligibility occurs 
within one year before the date on which the bankruptcy proceeding begins. Or, if group eligibility is lost 
within one year after the date on which the bankruptcy proceeding begins, they may enroll for lifetime 
continued group coverage as of the date group eligibility is lost. Spouses and/or eligible dependents of 
these retired employees may enroll for continued group coverage until the retired employee dies. Once the 
retired employee dies, their surviving spouse and/or eligible dependents may enroll for up to an additional 
36 months of continued group coverage beyond the date of the retired employee’s death. 
Lifetime continued coverage in this health plan for retired employees will end if the group cancels its 
agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide its group members  with coverage in this 
health plan under a group contract  or for any of the other reasons described below. (See “Termination of 
Continued Group Coverage.”) 
Enrollment for Continued Group Coverage 
In order to enroll for continued group coverage in this health plan, you must complete an Election Form. 
The completed election form must be returned to the office at the address on the form. The form must be 
returned within 60 days from your date of termination of group coverage or your notification of eligibility, 
whichever is later. If you do not return the completed form, it will be considered a waiver. And, you will 
not be allowed to continue coverage in this health plan under a group contract. (The 60 days will be counted 
from the date of the eligibility notice to the postmarked date of the mailed election form.) 
Termination of Continued Group Coverage 
Your continued group coverage will end when: 
 The length of time allowed for continued group coverage is reached (for example, 18 months or 
29 months or 36 months from the qualifying event). 
 You fail to make timely payment of your premiums. 
 You enroll in another employer sponsored health plan and that plan does not include pre-existing 
condition limitations or waiting periods. 
 You become entitled to Medicare benefits. 
 You are no longer disabled (if your continued group coverage had been extended because of 
disability). 
 The group terminates its agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  (or the Massachusetts 
Health Connector) to provide its group members  with access to health care services and benefits 
under this health plan. In this case, health care coverage may continue under another health plan. 
Contact your plan sponsor  or Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for more information. 
Medicare Program 
When you are eligible for Medicare and Medicare is allowed by federal law to be the primary payor, the 
coverage provided by this health plan will be reduced by the amount of benefits allowed under Medicare 
for the same covered services . This reduction will be made whether or not you actually receive the benefits 
from Medicare. Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 103 Under Age 65 with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
If you are under age 65 and are eligible for Medicare only because of ESRD (permanent kidney failure), 
the benefits of this health plan will be provided before Medicare benefits. This is the case only during the 
first 30 months of your ESRD Medicare coverage. After 30 months, the benefits that are provided by this 
health plan will be reduced by the amount that Medicare allows for the same covered services . 
Under Age 65 with Other Disability 
If your group employs 100 or more employees and if you are under age 65 and you are eligible for Medicare 
only because of a disability other than ESRD, this health plan will provide benefits before Medicare 
benefits. This is the case only if you are the actively employed subscriber  or the enrolled spouse or 
dependent of the actively employed subscriber . If you are an inactive employee or a retiree or the enrolled 
spouse or dependent of the inactive employee or retiree, the benefits that are provided by this health plan 
will be reduced by the amount that Medicare allows for the same covered services . (In some cases, this 
provision also applies to certain smaller groups. Your plan sponsor  can tell you if it applies to your group.) 
Age 65 or Older 
If your group employs 20 or more employees and if you are age 65 or older and are eligible for Medicare 
only because of age, this health plan will provide benefits before Medicare benefits as long as you have 
chosen this health plan as your primary payor. This can be the case only if you are an actively employed 
subscriber  or the enrolled spouse of the actively employed subscriber . (If you are actively employed at the 
time you reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you must choose between Medicare and this 
health plan as the primary payor of your health care benefits. For more help, contact your plan sponsor .) 
Dual Medicare Eligibility 
If you are eligible for Medicare because of ESRD and a disability or because of ESRD and you are age 
65 or older, this health plan will provide benefits before Medicare benefits. This is the case during the first 
30 months of your ESRD Medicare coverage only if the coverage under this health plan was primary when 
you became eligible for ESRD Medicare benefits. Then, for as long as you maintain dual Medicare 
eligibility, the benefits that are provided by this health plan will be reduced by the amount that Medicare 
allows for the same covered services . (This provision may not apply to you. To find out if it does, contact 
your plan sponsor .)

 Page 104 Part 12  
Individual Policy 
This part applies to you when you enroll in this health plan as a direct pay member (and not as a group 
member under a group contract ). Under an individual  contract, the subscriber  has an agreement with Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide the subscriber  and their enrolled eligible spouse and other enrolled 
eligible dependents with access to health care services and benefits. The subscriber  will make payments to 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for coverage in this health plan under an individual contract . For 
questions about enrollment and billing, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service 
office. 
Important Note: If you enrolled in this health plan through the Massachusetts Health Connector, the 
subscriber  has an agreement with the Health Connector and not Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The 
subscriber  will usually make payments to the Health Connector for coverage in this health plan. The Health 
Connector will send all notices to the subscriber . You must call the Health Connector directly for any 
questions about: your enrollment in this health plan; your premium payments; and any membership changes 
you need to make such as a change to your name or address. For any questions about your health plan 
coverage or your claims, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service office. 
Eligibility and Enrollment for Individual Coverage 
Eligible Individual 
You are eligible for coverage in this health plan under an individual  contract as long as you meet each of 
the following conditions: 
 You are a resident of Massachusetts. A “resident” is a person who lives in Massachusetts as shown by 
evidence that is considered acceptable by  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . This means Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  may ask you for evidence such as a lease or rental agreement, a mortgage bill, 
or a utility bill. The fact that you are in a nursing home, a hospital, or other institution does not by 
itself mean you are a resident. And, you are not a resident if you come to Massachusetts to receive 
medical care or to attend school but you still have residency outside of Massachusetts. 
 You live in the health plan’s Massachusetts service area . 
If you are under age 18 and you are requesting to enroll as a subscriber , the enrollment form must be 
completed by your parent or guardian. In this case, the person who is executing the contract (your parent 
or guardian) is not eligible for benefits under your coverage in this health plan. But, they will be responsible 
for acting on behalf of the subscriber  as necessary and for paying the monthly premium for your coverage. 
The person who executes the contract will be considered your authorized representative. 
This health plan is not a Medicare supplement plan.  If you are eligible for Medicare, this health plan 
cannot be issued to you. You should look at the Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare. You 
may be able to sign up for a health plan that is designed to supplement Medicare. To ask for a copy of the 
Guide, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. (See Part 1.) If you are 
already enrolled in this health plan when you become eligible for Medicare, you may choose to stay 
enrolled. If you choose to remain enrolled, Medicare may provide coverage for the same health care 
services that are covered by this health plan. In this case, Medicare is the primary payor. Part 12 – Individual Policy  (continued)

 Page 105 Eligible Spouse 
The subscriber  may enroll an eligible spouse for coverage in this health plan under their individual  contract. 
An “eligible spouse” includes the subscriber’s  legal spouse or legal civil union spouse. An eligible spouse 
must also meet all of the same eligibility conditions as described above for an eligible individual. (If the 
spouse is eligible for Medicare, this health plan cannot be issued to the spouse. You should use the Guide 
to Health Insurance for People with Medicare to find a health plan that is designed to supplement Medicare. 
To ask for a copy of the Guide, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office.) 
Former Spouse 
In the event of a divorce or a legal separation, the person who was the spouse of the subscriber  prior to the 
divorce or legal separation may maintain coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  individual  
contract. This coverage may continue only until: the subscriber  is no longer required by the divorce 
judgment to provide health insurance for the former spouse; or the subscriber  or former spouse remarries. 
In either case, the former spouse may wish to enroll as a subscriber  under their own individual  contract. 
The Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service office can help you with these options. In these 
situations, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  must be notified within 30 days of a change to the former 
spouse’s address. Otherwise, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not be liable for any acts or omissions 
due to having the former spouse’s incorrect address on file. 
Eligible Dependents 
The subscriber  may enroll eligible dependents for coverage in this health plan under their individual 
contract. Eligible dependents must meet all of the same eligibility conditions as described above for an 
eligible individual. However, a dependent child may live outside of the Massachusetts service area  to attend 
school as long as they have not moved out of Massachusetts permanently. “Eligible dependents” include 
the subscriber’s  (or subscriber’s  spouse’s) children until the end of the calendar month in which the child 
turns age 26. To be an eligible dependent, the child is not required to live with the subscriber  or the 
subscriber’s  spouse, be a dependent on the subscriber’s  or spouse’s tax return, or be a full-time student. 
These eligible dependents may include: 
 A newborn child. The effective date  of coverage for a newborn child will be the child’s date of birth 
provided that the subscriber  formally notifies Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue within 30 days of 
the date of birth. (A claim for a member’s  maternity admission may be considered by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue to be this notice when the subscriber’s  coverage is a family plan.) This health plan 
provides coverage for newborn infants for injury and sickness. This includes the necessary care and 
treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects, birth abnormalities, and premature birth. The 
coverage for these services is subject to all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 An adopted child. The effective date  of coverage for an adopted child will be the date of placement of 
the child with the subscriber  for the purpose of adoption. The effective date  of coverage for an 
adoptive child who has been living with the subscriber  and for whom the subscriber  has been getting 
foster care payments will be the date the petition to adopt is filed. If the subscriber  is enrolled under a 
family plan as of the date they assume custody of a child for the purpose of adoption, the child’s 
health care services for injury or sickness will be covered from the date of custody. (This coverage is 
provided without a waiting period or pre-existing condition restriction.) This includes the necessary 
care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects, birth abnormalities, and premature 
birth. The coverage for these services is subject to all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 A newborn infant of an enrolled dependent child immediately from the moment of birth and 
continuing after, until the enrolled dependent child is no longer eligible as a dependent. 
If an eligible dependent child is married, the dependent child can enroll for coverage under the subscriber’s 
individual contract . And, as long as that enrolled child is an eligible dependent, their children are also Part 12 – Individual Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 106 eligible for coverage under the subscriber’s individual contract . The dependent child’s spouse is not 
eligible to enroll as a dependent for coverage under the subscriber’s individual contract . 
An eligible dependent may also include: 
 A person under age 26 who is not the subscriber’s  (or the subscriber’s  spouse’s) child but who 
qualifies as a dependent of the subscriber  under the Internal Revenue Code. When the dependent 
loses their dependent status under the Internal Revenue Code, that dependent will continue to be 
eligible as a dependent for coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  individual contract  for 
two years after the end of the calendar year in which they last qualified as a dependent under the 
Internal Revenue Code or until the dependent turns age 26, whichever comes first. 
 A child recognized under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order as having the right to enroll for 
health care coverage. 
 A disabled dependent child  age 26 or older. A dependent child who is mentally or physically 
incapable of earning their own living and who is enrolled under the subscriber’s individual contract  
will continue to be covered after they would otherwise lose dependent eligibility under the 
subscriber’s individual contract , so long as the child continues to be mentally or physically incapable 
of earning their own living. In this case, the subscriber  must make arrangements with Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue not more than 30 days after the date the child would normally lose eligibility. 
Also, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue must be given any medical or other information that it may 
need to determine if the child can maintain coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  
individual contract . From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may conduct reviews that 
will require a statement from the attending physician. This is to confirm that the child is still an 
eligible disabled dependent child. 
Important Reminder: The eligibility provisions for dependents that are described in this section may differ 
from the federal tax laws that define who may qualify as a dependent.

 Page 107 Enrollment Process 
To apply for coverage in this health plan under an individual contract , you must complete an enrollment 
application. Send your completed application to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . You must also send

true, correct, and complete. Your right to coverage in this health plan under an individual contract  is based

and complete. 
During the enrollment process, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will check and verify each person’s 
eligibility for coverage in this health plan under an individual contract . This means that when you apply 
for coverage, you may be required to provide evidence that you are a resident of Massachusetts. Examples 
of evidence to show that you are a resident can be a copy of your lease or rental agreement, a mortgage bill, 
or a utility bill. If you are not a citizen of the United States, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also 
require that you provide official U.S. immigration documentation. You will also be asked to provide 
information about your prior health plan(s), and you may be required to provide a copy of your certificate(s) 
of health plan coverage. If you fail to provide the information to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  that it 
needs to verify your eligibility for an individual contract , Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will deny your 
enrollment request. Once you are enrolled in this health plan, each year prior to your health plan renewal 
date, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may check and verify that you are still eligible for coverage under 
an individual contract . 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may deny your enrollment for coverage, or cancel your coverage, in this 
health plan under an individual contract  for any of the following reasons: 
 You fail to provide information to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  that it needs to verify your 
eligibility for coverage in this health plan under an individual contract . 
 You committed misrepresentation or fraud to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  about your eligibility 
for coverage in this health plan under an individual contract . 
 You made at least three or more late payments for your health plan(s) in a 12-month period. 
 You voluntarily ended your coverage in this health plan within the past 12 months on a date that is 
not your renewal date. But, this does not apply if you had creditable coverage (as defined by state 
law) continuously up to a date not more than 63 days prior to the date of your request for enrollment 
in this health plan under an individual contract . 
If your enrollment request is denied or your coverage is canceled, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
send you a letter that will tell you the specific reason(s) for which they have denied (or canceled) your 
coverage in this health plan under an individual contract . This information will be made available, upon 
request, to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance. 
Newly enrolled members will not have a waiting period before Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
provide access to health care services and benefits. 
Membership Changes 
Generally, the subscriber  may make membership changes (for example, change from a plan that covers 
only one person to a family plan) only if the subscriber  has a change in family status. This includes a change 
such as: marriage or divorce; birth, adoption or change in custody of a child; death of an enrolled spouse or 
dependent; or the loss of an enrolled dependent’s eligibility under the subscriber’s individual contract . If 
you want to ask for a membership change or you need to change your name or mailing address, you should 
call or write to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send you any Part 12 – Individual Policy  (continued)

the change. Or, if the newly eligible person had prior creditable coverage (as defined by state law), the 
change must be requested within 63 days of the termination date of the prior qualified health care coverage. 
If you do not request the change within the time required, you will have to wait until the next annual open 
enrollment period to make the change. All changes are allowed only when they comply with the conditions 
outlined in the individual contract and with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  policies. (If you enrolled in 
this health plan through the Massachusetts Health Connector, the Health Connector’s policies may apply 
in addition to or in place of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  policies. If this applies to you, you must call
