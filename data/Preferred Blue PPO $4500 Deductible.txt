$4,500 Deductible  
This is the Schedule of Benefits  that is a part of your Subscriber Certificate . This chart describes the cost 
share amounts that you will have to pay for covered services. It also shows the benefi t limits  that apply for 
covered services. Do not rely on this chart alone. Be sure to read all parts of your Subscriber 
Certificate to understand the requirements you must follow to receive all of your coverage. You 
should also read the descriptions of cov ered services and the limitations and exclusions that apply 
for this coverage . All words that show in italics are explained in Part 2. To receive the highest level of 
coverage, you must obtain your health care services and supplies from covered  providers  who 
participate in your health plan’s provider network.  Also, for some health care services, you may have 
to have an approved referral from your primary care provider or approval from your health plan in order 
for you to receive coverage from your health pl an. These requirements are fully outlined in Part  4. If a 
referral or an approval i s required, you should make sure that you have it b efore you receive your health 
care service. Otherwise, you may have to pay all costs for the health care service.  
Your health plan’s provider network is the PPO provider network . See Part  1 for information about how 
to find a provider in your health care network.  
The following definitions will help you understand your cost share amounts and how they are calculated. 
·A deductib le is the cost you may have to pay for certain covered services  you receive during your
annual coverage period before benefits are paid by the health plan. This chart shows the dollar
amount of your deductible  and the covered services for which you must fi rst pay the deductible .
·A copayment  is the fixed dollar amount you may have to pay for a covered service , usually when y ou
r
eceive the covered service. This chart shows the times when you will have to pay a copayment .
·A coinsurance is the percentage (for example, 20%) you may have to pay for a covered service. This
chart shows the times, if there are any, when you will have to pay coinsurance .
Your cost share will be calculated based on the allowed charge  or the provider’s actual charge if it is less 
than t he allowed charge . You will not have to pay charges that are more than the allowed charge  when 
you use a covered  provider  who participates  in your health care network to furnish covered services. But, 
when you use an out -of-network provider, you may also have to pay all charges that are in excess of 
the allowed charge  for covered services. This is called “ balance billing .” These balance billed charges 
are in addition to the cost share you have to pay for covered services. (Exceptions to this paragraph 
are explained in Part  2.) 
IMPORTANT NOTE:  The provisions described in this Schedule of Benefits may change. If this 
happens, the change is described in a rider . Be sure to read each rider (if there are any) that applies to 
your coverage in this health plan to s ee if it changes this Schedule of Benefits . 
The explanation of any special provisions as noted by an asterisk can be found after this chart. Schedule of Benef its (continue d) Preferred Blue PPO

covered services  during your annual coverage period 
before benefits will be paid for those covered services . 
Your deductible  per plan year  is: 
This deductible  applies to all covered services  except

deductible . 
The family deductible  can be met by eligible costs 
incurred by any combination of members  enrolled under 
the same family plan. But, no one member  will have to 
pay more  than the per member  deductible . 
Out-of-Pocket Maximum  The out-of-pocket maximum  is the most you could pay 
during your annual coverage period for your share of the 
costs for covered services . 
Your out-of-pocket maximum  per plan year  is: 
This out-of-pocket maximum  is a total of the deductible , 
copayments , and coinsurance  you pay for covered 
services . $9,100 per member  
$18,200 per family  $18,200 per member

Prescription Drugs  
This rider  modifies the terms of your health plan. Please keep this rider  with your Subscriber Certificate 
for easy reference.  
The outpatient  benefits described in your Subscriber Certificate for covered drugs and supplies have bee n 
changed.  
When you buy a covered drug, the pharmacist will give you a generic equivalent of the prescribed drug 
whenever it is allowed. If you choose to buy the brand -name drug instead of the generic drug equivalent, 
your out -of-pocket costs will be more. For these covered brand- name drugs, your cost will be calculated 
based on your benefits for the generic drug equivalent. This means that your cost share amount (copayment  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies) will be the same cost share amount that you w ould 
have paid for the covered generic drug equivalent.  
In addition to your cost share amount, you must pay the difference between the allowed charge for the 
brand- name d rug and the allowed charge  for the generic drug equivalent. All costs that you pay fo r these 
covered drugs will count towards your out -of-pocket maximum . 
Important Note:  When your plan option includes a deductible  that applies for prescription drugs, thi s 
provision does not  apply until the deductible  has been met.

relating to preg nancy; contracep tion; assisted reproduction;  miscarriage management ; or termination of

Except as described below  for abortion and abortion -related care,  your coverage for covered reproductive 
health care services is provided to the same extent a s coverage is provided for similar covered services  to 
treat other physical conditions . (Your Schedule of Benefits describes your cost share amount. Also  refer to 
riders— if there are any —that apply to your coverage in this health plan.)

Cost Share Assistance Pharmacy Program  
This rider  modifies the terms of your health plan. Please keep this rider  with your Subscriber Certificate 
for easy reference.  
The outpatient  benefits described in your Subscriber Certificate for covered drugs and supplies have been 
changed.  
Your health plan includes a cost share assistance program for certain specialty drugs and/or supplies. Cost 
share assistance is a process in which the healt h plan facilitates your enrollment in a program where drug 
manufactur ers provide financial support to members  by reducing or removing cost share  applied to a drug 
and/or supply.  
For covered drugs and supplies that are eligible under this cost share assistance program , the initial cost 
share amount that is provided will be e qual to 30% of the total cost of the drug or supply.  
When you enroll for cost share assistance with a drug manufacturer for an eligible covered drug or 
supply, the initial cost share amou nt will be either reduced or removed. In these cases, cost share 
assistance is provided by a drug manufacturer on the initial cost share. This means that your final cost 
share amount will be calculated based off of the initial cost share amount minus the d rug manufacturer’s 
cost share assistance. The final cost share amount  that you will pay is described in the cost share 
assistance drug list.  
If you choose not to enroll for cost share assistance with a drug manufacturer for an eligible covered drug or supply, the initial cost share amount will not  be reduced or removed and your cost share amount will be 
higher . Thi s means that the final cost share amount that you will pay is equal to 30% of the total cost of 
the drug or supply.  
There may be times when you cannot enroll for cost share assistance wit h a drug manufacturer for a  
certain covered drug or supply that may otherwise be eligible under this cost share assistance program. 
Some examples of when this will occur include (but are not limited to): when the drug or supply is not 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat your condition; or, when the drug or  supply has 
specific age restrictions that you do not meet. In these cases, the provisions of this cost share assistance 
program will not apply, and you will pay the cost share amount tha t applies for all other cov ered drugs 
and supplies  as described in yo ur Schedule of Benefits and/or riders.  
The cost share amounts that you pay for these drugs and supplies as described above will count toward 
your out -of-pocket maximum . 
To obtain the cost share assistance drug list  that describes the drugs and/or supplies eligible for cost share 
assistance and their applicable cost share, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer 
service office. The toll- free phone number is shown on your I D card. Or, you may log on to the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internet Web site at www.bluecrossma.org. The list of these specialty 
drugs and supplies may change from time to time.  
This rider does not change the cost share amount that you will pay for all other covered drugs and  
supplies. Refer to your Schedule of Benef its and/or riders  for your cost share amount for other covered 
drugs and supplies.

essential dental benefits. It also shows the cost -sharing amounts you must pay for these covered  services .

familiar with the key points. Be s ure to read the descriptions of covered services and the limitations 
and exclusions.  You should keep your Dental Blue Policy and this Schedule of Dental Benefits  handy so

the same family membership)  
The deductible  is the cost you have to pay during the annual coverage period (as shown above) before

more members  who are eligible for pediatric 
essential dental benefits and who are enrolled under 
the same family membership)  
Your out -of-pocket maximum  is the most you could pay during the annual coverage period (as shown 
above ) for your sha re of the costs for covered services —your cost -sharing amounts. This out -of-pocket 
maximum helps you plan for health care expenses . Even though you pay the following costs, they do not 
count toward your out-of-pocket maximum : your premiums ; any balance -billed charges; all costs for 
dental services for members  who are not eligible for pediatric essential dental benefits ; and all services

  WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 1 Introduction 
This Subscriber Certificate explains your health car e coverage and the terms of your enrollment in this Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Preferred Blue PPO health plan. It describes your responsibilities to receive 
health care coverage and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  responsibilities to you. This Subscriber 
Certificate also has a Schedule of Benefits for your specific plan option. This schedule describes the cost 
share amounts that you must pay for covered services  (such as a deductible  or a copayment ). You should 
read all parts of this Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  to become familiar with the key 
points. You should keep them handy so that you can refe r to them. The words that are shown in italics have 
special meanings. These words are explained in Part 2 of this Subscriber Certificate. 
When you enroll for coverage in this Prefe rred Blue PPO health plan, you may enroll as a group member  
under a group contract . Or, you may enroll directly under an individual contract . The contract for coverage 
in this health plan is a prepaid (“insured”) preferred provider plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
certifies that you have the right to this health care coverage as long as: you are enrolled in this health plan when you receive covered services ; the premium  that is owed for your hea lth plan has been paid to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ; and you follow all of the requirements to receive this health care coverage. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is located at: 101 Huntington Avenue, Suite 1300, Boston, 
Massachusetts 02199-7611. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and/or your group  (when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group 
member ) may change the health care coverage described  in this Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule 
of Benefits . If this is the case, the change is described in a rider . Please keep any riders  with your Subscriber 
Certificate and Schedule of Benefits  so that you can refer to them. 
This health plan is a preferred provider health plan . This means that you determine the costs that you will 
pay each time you choose a health  care provider to furnish covered services . You will receive the highest 
level of benefits when you use health care providers who participate in your PPO  health care network. 
These are called your “in-network benefits.” If you choo se to use covered health care providers who do not 
participate in your PPO health care network, you  will usually receive a lower level of benefits. In this case, 
your out-of-pocket costs will be more. These ar e called your “out-of-network benefits.” 
Before using your health care c overage, you should make note of the limits and exclusions. These limits 
and exclusions are described in this Subscriber Certificate in Parts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
The term “you” refers to any member  who has the right to the coverage provided by this health plan—the 
subscriber  or the enrolled spouse or any other enrolled dependent. 
 WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 2 Part 1  
Member Services 
Your Primary Care Provider 
As a member  of this health plan, you are not required to choose a primary care provider to coordinate the 
health care benefits described in this Subscriber Certificate. However, your PPO health care network 
includes physicians who are family or  general practitioners, internists, pe diatricians, geriatric specialists, 
nurse practitioners, and physician assistants that you ma y choose to furnish your primary medical care. You 
may choose any covered provider  to furnish your health care serv ices and supplies. But, your choice 
is important because it may impact the costs that you pay for some health care services. 
How to Determine a Preferred Physician’s Specialty 
To determine a preferred physician’s  specialty, you can look in your PPO provider directory or use the 
online “Find a Doctor” physician directory. Some pref erred physicians may have more than one specialty. 
When your health plan has a cost share that diffe rs based on the preferred physician’s specialty type, Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will use the primary specialty type as shown in the PPO provider directory to 
determine your cost share amount. For example, a pr eferred physician may be pr imarily a dermatologist 
but may also be a family practitioner. In this case,  your cost share amount is determined based on the 
“dermatologist” specialty type si nce it is the preferred physician’s primary specialty as shown in the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  PPO provider directory. A preferred phys ician may change their specialty at 
any time. However, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will change a preferred physician’s specialty only 
once every two years. 
Some preferred physicians and other professional pr ovider types are part of a multi-specialty provider 
group. When your health plan has a cost share that di ffers based on the preferred physician’s specialty type, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will apply the lower cost share amount for primary care provider 
specialty types to the multi-specialty provider groups. 
In other states, the local Blue Cro ss and/or Blue Shield Plan may have established provider specialty types 
that are not recognized by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . In those cases when a preferred physician’s 
specialty type or professional provider type is not recognized, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will apply 
the higher cost share amount for specialists and other non-primary care provider specialty types. 
Refer to the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option to see if your cost share amount is based on a preferred 
physician’s  specialty type or other provider type. 
Your Health Care Network 
This health plan consists of two benefit levels: one for in-network benefits; and one for out-of-network 
benefits. The costs that you pay for covered services  will differ based on the benefit level. To receive the 
highest benefit level (your in-network benefits), you must obtain your health care services and supplies  
from providers who participate in your PPO health car e network. These health care providers are referred 
to as “ preferred providers. ” (See “ covered providers ” in Part 2.) If you choose to obtain your health care 
services and supplies from a covered provider  who does not participate in this PPO health care network, 
you will usually receive the lowest bene fit level (your out-of-network benefits ). See Part 8 in this Subscriber 
Certificate for the times when  in-network benefits will be provided if you receive covered services from a 
covered provider  who is not a preferred provider . Part 1 – Member Services  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 3 When You Need Help to Find a Health Care Provider

will be made available to you at no additional cost. To find out if a health care provider participates in your 
health care network, you can look in this provider di rectory. Or, you can also use any one of the following

(For some types of covered providers , a local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan may not have, in the

the case and you obtain covered services  from this type of covered provider , the in-network benefit level 
will be provided for these covered services . See Part 8 in this Subscriber Certificate.) If you are outside the 
United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Island s, there are no local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
Plans. But, you can still call 1-800-810-BLUE. (Or, you can  call collect at 1-804-673-1177.) In this case, 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Cent er can help you to access a health care provider. Then, 
if you are admitted as an inpatient , you should call the service center a nd the hospital should submit the 
claim for you. (See Part 9.)

you as a person who has the right to coverage in this health plan. The ID card is for identification purposes 
only. Under federal law, your ID card is requi red to include information about applicable deductible  and

Your Rights under Mental Health Parity Laws 
This health plan provides coverage for medically necessary  mental health and substance use treatment 
according to federal and state mental health parity la ws. The financial requirements and treatment limits for 
your mental health or substance use coverage can be no more restrictive than those for your medical and 
surgical coverage. This means that the cost share amounts (a copayment , coinsurance , or deductible ) for 
services to treat mental health and substance use will be  the same or less than tho se for comparable medical 
and surgical services. Also, the review and authorizati on of services to treat mental health or substance use 
will be handled in a way that is comparable to the revi ew and authorization of medical and surgical services. 
If Blue Cross Blue Shield  HMO Blue  makes a decision to deny or reduce authorization of a service, you 
will receive a letter that explains th e reason for the denial or reduction. Blue Cross Blue Shield  HMO Blue  
will send you or your health care provider a copy of the cr iteria used to make this decision, at your request. 
You should be sure to read all parts of your Subscriber  Certificate to understand y our health plan coverage. 
If you believe that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue is not compliant with these mental health parity laws, 
you can make a complaint to the Massa chusetts Division of Insurance (the Division) Consumer Services 
Section. A complaint can be made by phone or in writing. To send a written complaint, you must use the 
Division’s “Insurance Complaint Form .” You can request a copy of this  form from the Division by phone 
or by mail. You can also find this form on the Division’s Web site at http://www.mass.gov/ocabr/consumer/insurance/ file-a-complaint/filing-a-complaint.html . To make a 
complaint by phone, call 1-877-563-4467  or 1-617-521-7794 . If you do make your complaint by phone,

When you make a complaint, you must include: your name and address; the nature of your complaint; and 
your signature authorizing the release of any informati on about the complaint to help the Division with its 
review. 
In addition to filing a written complaint with the Division, you must file an appeal  with Blue Cross Blue 
Shield  HMO Blue  to have your denial or reduc tion in coverage reviewed. This  may be necessary to protect 
your right to continued cove rage while you wait for an appeal  decision. To file an appeal  with Blue Cross 
Blue Shield  HMO Blue , you must follow the formal review procedures outlined in Part 10.

 WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 8 Part 2  
Explanation of Terms 
The following words are shown in italics in this Subscriber Certificate, your Schedule of Benefits , and any 
riders  that apply to your coverage in  this health plan. The meaning of  these words will help you understand 
your benefits. 
Allowed Charge (Allowed Amount) 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  calculates payment of your benefits based on the allowed charge  
(sometimes referred to as the  allowed amount ). This is the maximum amount  on which payment is based 
for covered health care services. This may be calle d “eligible expense,” “payment allowance,” or 
“negotiated rate.” The allowed charge  that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses depends on the type of 
health care provider that furnishes the covered service  to you. If your health care provider charges you more 
than the allowed  amount , you may have to pay the difference (see below). 
 For Preferred Providers in Massachusetts.  For health care providers who have a preferred provider 
arrangement (a “PPO payment agreement”) with Blue Cross  Blue Shield HMO Blue , the allowed 
charge  is based on the provisions of that hea lth care provider’s PPO payment agreement. For covered 
services  furnished by these health care providers, you pay only your deductible  and/or your 
copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. In general, when you share in the cost for 
your covered services  (such as a deductible , and/or a copayment  and/or a coinsurance ), the 
calculation for the amount that you pay is based on the initial full allowed charge  for that health care 
provider (or the actual charge if it is less). This amount that you pay for a covered service  is generally 
not subject to future adjustments—up or down—ev en though the health care provider’s payment may 
be subject to future adjustments for such thin gs as provider contractual settlements, risk-sharing 
settlements, and fraud or other operations. 
A preferred provider’s  payment agreement may provide for an allowed charge  that is more than the 
provider’s actual charge. For example, a hospital’s allowed charge  for an inpatient  admission may be 
based on a “Diagnosis Related Grouping” (DRG). In this case, the allowed charge  may be more than 
the hospital’s actual charge. If this is the case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will calculate your 
cost share amount based on th e lesser amount—this means the preferred provider’s  actual charge 
instead of the allowed charge  will be used to calculate your cost  share. The claim payment made to 
the preferred provider  will be the full amount of the allowed charge  less your cost share amount. 
 For Health Care Providers Outside of Massac husetts with a Local Payment Agreement.  For 
health care providers outside of Massachusetts who have a payment agreement with the local Blue 
Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan, the allowed charge  is the “negotiated price” that the local Blue Cross 
and/or Blue Shield Plan passes on to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (Blue Cross and/or Blue 
Shield Plan means an independent corporation or  affiliate operating under a license from the Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield Association.) In many cases, the negotiated price paid by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  to the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan is a discount from the provider’s 
billed charges. However, a number of local Blue Cr oss and/or Blue Shield Plans can determine only 
an estimated price at the time your claim is paid . Any such estimated price is based on expected 
settlements, withholds, any other c ontingent payment arrangements a nd non-claims transactions, such 
as interest on provider advances, with the provider (o r with a specific group of providers) of the local Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 9 Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in the area where services are received. In addition, some local 
Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans’ payment ag reements with providers do not give a comparable 
discount for all claims. These local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans elect to smooth out the effect 
of their payment agreements with providers by appl ying an average discount to claims. The price that 
reflects average savings may result in greater variatio n (more or less) from the actual price paid than 
will the estimated price. Local Blue Cross and/or  Blue Shield Plans that  use these estimated or 
averaging methods to calculate the negotiated pri ce may prospectively adjust their estimated or 
average prices to correct for overestimating or unde restimating past prices. However, the amount you 
pay is considered a final price. In most cases for covered services  furnished by these health care 
providers, you pay only your deductible  and/or your copayment  and/or your coinsurance , 
whichever applies.  
Value-Based Provider Arrangements: A provider’s paym ent agreement with a local Blue Cross and/or 
Blue Shield Plan may include: a payment arrangeme nt based on health outcomes; and/or coordination 
of care features. Under these payment agreements, the providers will be assessed against cost and 
quality standards. Payments to these providers may include provider incentives, risk sharing, and/or 
care coordination fees. If you receive covered services  from such a provider, you will not have to pay 
any cost share for these fees, excep t when a local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan passes these 
fees to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments for 
claims for covered services . When this happens, you pay only your deductible  and/or your copayment  
and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. 
 For Other Health Care Providers. For covered health care providers who do not have a PPO 
payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or for health care providers outside of 
Massachusetts who do not have a payment agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
Plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will use the methods outlined below to calculate your claim 
payment. 
Patient Protections Against Surprise Billing  
Under federal law, you are protected from “balan ce billing” or “surprise billing” (an unexpected 
balance bill) in certain situations. Under th e law, you cannot be balance billed for certain covered 
services that you may receive. But, for these covered services , you will continue to be responsible for 
any copayment , deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies. 
You cannot be balance billed  when you receive: 
 Emergency services.  This includes: emergency services you receive at an emergency room of a 
hospital or an independent free-sta nding emergency facility; and certain covered services  that 
may be required to stabilize you (post-stabilizati on services) until such time that your attending 
physician determines you meet certain criteria as outlined under federal law. When you become 
stabilized and any notice and consent requirements  as specified in the st atute are met, surprise 
billing protection no longer applies. See “All Ot her Covered Services” below for how your claim 
payment will be calculated when this happens. 
 Non-emergency services furnished by a non- preferred provider  at certain preferred facilities. 
This includes services you receive at: a hospital; a hospital outpatient department; a critical access hospital; an ambulatory surgical center; or a ny other facility designated by the statute that 
provides items or services for which coverage is provided under this health plan unless the notice and consent requirements as specified in the stat ute have been met. A provider or facility cannot 
provide notice and receive consent for certain ancillary services, as defined by the No Surprises Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 10 Act, including items or services related to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, 
radiology and neonatology. This also includ es services provided by assistant surgeons and 
diagnostic services. 
 Air ambulance services by a non-preferred air ambulance provider.  
For the covered services  described above, the “recognized amount” will be used to calculate your cost 
share amount ( deductible and/or copaymen t and/or coinsurance ). The recognized amount is defined 
by federal law as: an amount determined by an  applicable All-Payer Model Agreement under 
Section 1115A of the Social Security Act; or, if there is no applicable All-Payer Model Agreement, 
an amount determined by a specified state law wher e the services were furnished; or, if there is no 
applicable All-Payer Model Agreement or specified  state law, the lesser of the amount billed by the 
provider or facility or the Qualified Payment Amount  (QPA), which under the final rules generally is 
the median of the contracted rates of the plan or issuer for the item or service in the geographic 
region. 
For covered services  furnished in Massachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses the QPA as 
the recognized amount to calculate your claim payment. For covered services  furnished in a state 
other than Massachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses the applicable recognized amount 
that is provided by the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan for that state to calculate your claim 
payment. Any cost share amounts that you pay for these covered services will count toward your 
in-network deductible (if applicable) and your  out-of-pocket maximum . (If a non- preferred provider  is 
dissatisfied with a payment made by the health plan , the provider can initiate a structured process to 
resolve the dispute. Federal law protects you from any payment disputes that may arise between plans 
and providers.) Note: The QPA will be used as the recognized amount to calculate your claim 
payment for covered air ambulance tr ansport that is furnished by a non- preferred provider  in or 
outside of Massachusetts. 
All Other Covered Services 
For all other covered services not described above that are not protected from surprise billing by the 
No Surprises Act, the  allowed charge  is based on 150% of the Medicare reimbursement rate. If there 
is no established Medicare reimbursement rate, the allowed charge is based on the amount 
determined by using current publicly-available da ta reflecting fees typically reimbursed for the 
covered service , adjusted for geographic differences. (There may be times when the Medicare 
reimbursement rate is not available for part of a claim for covered services . When this happens, the 
allowed charge will be based on the lesser of: the total of the Medicare reimbursement rate for the 
part for which there is a Medicare reimbursement rate  plus the provider’s actual charge for the part 
for which there is no Medicare reimbursement rate ; or the amount determined by using the current 
publicly-available data de scribed above for all parts of the claim for the covered services .) Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  has the discretion to determine what current publicly-available data it deems 
applicable, by using the data maintained by a th ird party of its choice. In no event will the allowed 
charge  be more than the health care pr ovider’s actual charge. However, the allowed charge  may 
sometimes be less than the health  care provider’s actual charge. If this is the case, you will be 
responsible for the amount of the covered provider’s  actual charge that is in excess of the allowed 
charge . This is called “ balance billing ”. This is in addition to your deductible  and/or your  copayment  
and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. For this reason, you may wish to discuss charges with 
your health care provider before you receive covered services . There are a few exceptions. This 
provision does not apply to ground ambulance transport for emergency medical care  or covered 
services for which there is no established allowed charge  (such as services received outside the Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 11 United States). For these covered services , the full amount of the health care provider’s actual charge 
is used to calculate your claim payment. 
Exception: For health care providers who do not have a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue  
Shield HMO Blue  or, for health care providers outside of Massachusetts, with the local Blue Cross 
and/or Blue Shield Plan, there may be times when Blue Cross Blue  Shield HMO Blue is able to 
negotiate a fee with the prov ider that is less than the allowed charge  that would have been used to 
calculate your claim payment (as described in the above paragraph). Wh en this happens, the 
“negotiated fee” will be used as the allowed charge  to calculate your claim payment and you will not 
have to pay the amount of the provider’s charge th at is in excess of the negotiated fee. You will only 
have to pay your deductible  and/or your  copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. Blue 
Cross Blue  Shield  HMO Blue  will send you a written notice about your claim that will tell you how 
your claim was calculated, including the allowed charge , the amount paid to the provider, and the 
amount you must pay to the provider. 
Pharmacy Providers 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may have payment arrangements w ith pharmacy providers that may 
result in rebates on covered drugs and supplies. The cost that you pay for a covered drug or supply is 
determined at the time you buy the drug or supply. The cost that you pay will not be adjusted for any later 
rebates, settlements, or other monies paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  from pharmacy providers 
or vendors. 
Appeal 
An appeal  is something you do if you disagree with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decision to deny 
a request for coverage of health care services or drugs, or payment, in part or in full, for services or drugs 
you already received. You may also make an appeal  if you disagree with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue decision to stop coverage for services that you ar e receiving. For example, you may ask for an appeal  
if Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  doesn’t pay for a service, item, or drug that you think you should be 
able to receive. Part 10 explains what you have to do to make an appeal . It also explains the review process. 
Balance Billing 
There may be certain times when a health care provi der will bill you for the difference between the 
provider’s charge and the allowed charge . This is called balance billing . A preferred provider  cannot 
balance bill  you for covered services . See “ allowed charge ” above for information about the allowed 
charge  and the times when a health care provider may balance bill  you. 
Benefit Limit 
For certain health care services or supplies, there may be  day, visit, or dollar be nefit maximums that apply 
to your coverage in this health plan. The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option and Part 5 of this 
Subscriber Certificate describe the benefit limits  that apply to your coverage. (Also refer to riders —if there 
are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) Once the amount of the benefits that you have 
received reaches the benefit limit  for a specific covered service , no more benefits will be provided by this 
health plan for those health care services or suppli es. When this happens, you must pay the full amount of 
the provider’s charges that you incur for those health care services or supplies that are more than the benefit 
limit. An overall lifetime benefit limit will not apply for coverage in this health plan. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued)

 Page 12 Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue , Inc. is the not-for-profit managed care subsidiary 
of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is licensed by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a health main tenance organization (HMO) to arrange for the 
coordinated delivery of health care services to its members . The term “Plan” is often used to refer to Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. “Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ” and “ Plan ” 
also means an employee or designee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. 
(including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts , Inc. or another Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
Plan) who is authorized to make decisions or take acti on called for by this health plan. This also means, for 
example, that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  policies, programs, documents, tools, and administrative 
areas may mean the policies, programs, documents, tools,  and administrative areas of Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. or another designee. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has full discretionary 
authority to interpret this Subscriber Certificate.  This includes determining the amount, form, and timing 
of benefits, conducting medical necessity reviews, and resolving any other matters regarding your right to 
benefits for covered services  as described in this Subscriber Ce rtificate. All determinations by Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue with respect to benefits under this health plan will be conclusive and binding unless 
it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious. 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. is th e parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. ( Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ). Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts, Inc. has entered into a management contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to 
provide administrative services. Blue Cross and Blue Sh ield of Massachusetts, Inc. will not be responsible 
for or have any contractual obligations with respect to  this health plan. “Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts, Inc.” also means an employee or designee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, 
Inc. who is authorized to make decisions or  take action called for by this health plan. 
Coinsurance 
For some covered services , you may have to pay a coinsurance . This means the cost that you pay for these 
covered services (your “cost share amount”) will be calculated as a percentage. When a coinsurance does 
apply to a specific covered service , Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will calculate your cost share amount 
based on the health care provider’s actual charge or the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge , 
whichever is less (unless otherwise required by law). The Schedule of Benefits for your plan option shows 
the covered services for which you must pay a coinsurance (if there are any). If a coinsurance  does apply, 
your Schedule of Benefits  also shows the percentage that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will use to 
calculate your cost share amount. (Also refer to riders —if there are any—that apply to your coverage in 
this health plan.) 
Copayment 
For some covered services , you may have to pay a copayment . This means the cost that you pay for these 
covered services  (your “cost share amount”) is a fixed dollar amount. In most cases, a covered provider  
will collect the copayment  from you at the time they furnish the covered service . However, when the health 
care provider’s actual charge at the time of providing the covered service  is less than your copayment , you 
pay only that health care provider’s actual charge or the  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue allowed charge , 
whichever is less (unless otherwise required by law) . Any later charge adjust ment—up or down—will not 
affect your copayment  (or the cost you were charged at the time of the service if it was less than the 
copayment ). The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option shows the amount of your copayment . It also 
shows those covered services  for which you must pay a copayment . (Also refer to riders —if there are any—
that apply to coverage in this health plan.) Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 13 Covered Providers 
To receive the highest benefit level under this health plan (your in-network benefits), you must obtain your 
health care services and supplies  from covered providers  who participate in your PPO health care network.

provider who has a written preferred provider arrangement  (a “PPO payment agreem ent”) with, or that has 
been designated by, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or with a local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan 
to provide access to covered services  to members . You also have the option to seek covered services  from 
a covered provider  who is not a preferred provider . (These health care providers are often called 
“non- preferred providers .”) In this case, you will usually receive the lowest benefit level under this health 
plan (your out-of-network benefits). To find out if a health care provider participates in your PPO health 
care network, you can look in the provider directory that is provided for your specific plan option. 
The kinds of health care providers that are covered providers  are those that are listed  below in this section.

Covered Services 
This Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  describe the health care services and supplies for 
which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will provide coverage for you while you are enrolled in this health 
plan. (Also refer to riders —if there are any—that apply to your cove rage in this health plan.) These health 
care services and supplies are referred to as “ covered services .” Except as described otherwise in this 
Subscriber Certificate, all covered services  must be medically necessary  for you, furnished by covered 
providers  and, when it is required, approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 14 Custodial Care 
Custodial care is a type of care that is not covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Custodial care  
means any of the following : 
 Care that is given primarily by medically-trained personnel for a member  who shows no significant 
improvement response despite extended or repeated treatment; or 
 Care that is given for a condition that is not likely to improve, even if the member  receives attention 
of medically-trained personnel; or 
 Care that is given for the maintenance and monito ring of an established treatment program, when no 
other aspects of treatment require an acute level of care; or 
 Care that is given for the purpose of meeting pe rsonal needs which could be provided by persons 
without medical training, such as assistance with mobility, dressing, bathing, eating and preparation 
of special diets, and taking medications. 
Custodial care does not include the habilitation services that are described as a covered service in Part 5.  
Deductible 
For some covered services , you may have to pay a deductible before  you will receive benefits from this 
health plan. When your plan option includes a deductible , the amount that is put toward your deductible  is 
generally calculated based on the health care provider’s actual charge or the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue allowed charge , whichever is less (unless otherwise requi red by law). As required by federal law for 
“surprise billing,” any deductible  that applies for certain covered services that are furnished by 
non-preferred providers  will be calculated based on the rec ognized amount and will contribute toward 
satisfying your in-network deductible  (see Part 2, “Allowed Charge” for an explanation of these services). 
Your ID card and the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option show the amount of your deductible  (if there 
is one). Your Schedule of Benefits  also shows those covered services  for which you must pay the deductible  
before you receive bene fits. (Also refer to riders —if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this 
health plan.) When a deductible  does apply, there are some costs that  you pay that do not count toward the 
deductible . These costs that do not count toward the deductible  are: 
 Any copayments  and/or coinsurance  you pay. 
 The costs you pay when your coverage is re duced or denied because you did not follow the 
requirements of the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  utilization review  program. (See Part 4.) 
 The costs you pay that are more than the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge . 
 The costs you pay because your health plan has pr ovided all of the benefits it allows for that covered 
service . 
(There may be certain times when amounts that you have paid toward a deductible under a prior health plan 
or contract may be counted toward satisfying your deductible  under this health plan. To see if this applies 
to you, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office.) 
The deductible  is indexed to the average national prem ium growth and the amount may be increased 
annually. This means that your  deductible  amount may increase from time to time, as determined by Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you if this happens. However, 
the amount of your deductible  will never be more than the maximum deductible  amount allowed under 
applicable law. 
Diagnostic Lab Tests 
This health plan provides coverage for diagnostic lab tests . These covered services  include tests which 
analyze samples from the body such as blood, waste, or tissue. These tests include (but are not limited to): Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 15 12-lead electrocardiograms; standard electroencepha lograms; and glycosylat ed hemoglobin (HgbA1C) 
tests, urinary protein/microalbumin tests, a nd lipid profiles to diagnose and treat diabetes. 
Diagnostic X-Ray and Other Imaging Tests 
This health plan provides coverage for diagnostic x-ray and other imaging tests . These tests provide an 
internal image of the body and are recorded as permanen t pictures, such as film. These tests can be low-tech 
radiology services, such as ultrasounds, x-rays, and fluoro scopic tests. Or, they can be high-tech radiology 
services, such as computerized axial tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron 
emission tomography (PET scans), and nuclear cardiac imaging. Imaging tests may pair pictures of the body with functional measurements, such as a barium swallow test. 
Effective Date 
This term is used to mean the date, as shown on Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  records, on which 
your coverage in this health plan starts. Or, it means the date on which a change to your coverage in this 
health plan takes effect. 
Emergency Medical Care 
As a member  of this health plan, you have worldwide coverage for emergency medical care . This is the 
type of care you need immediately due to the sudden onset of an emergency medical condition. An “emergency medical condition” is a medical condition, whether physical, behavior al, related to substance 
use, or mental, manifesting itself by acute symptoms of  sufficient severity (including severe pain) that, in 
the absence of prompt care, could reasonably be exp ected by a prudent layperson who has an average 
knowledge of health and medicine to result in: 
 placing your life or health or the health of another (including an unborn child) in serious jeopardy; or 
 serious impairment of bodily functions; or 
 serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or, 
 as determined by a provider with knowledge of your  condition, severe pain that cannot be managed 
without such care. 
Some examples of conditions that require emergency medical care  are: suspected heart attacks; strokes; 
poisoning; loss of consciousness; convulsions; and suic ide attempts. This also includes treatment of mental 
conditions  when: you are admitted as an inpatient  as required under Massachusetts General Laws, 
Chapter 123, Section 12; you seem very  likely to endanger yourself as show n by a serious suicide attempt, 
a plan to commit suicide, or behavior that shows that you are not able to care for yourself; or you seem very 
likely to endanger others as shown by an action agai nst another person that could cause serious physical 
injury or death or by a plan to harm another person. 
For purposes of filing a claim or the formal appeal  and grievance  review (see Parts 9 and 10 of this 
Subscriber Certificate), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  considers “ emergency medical care ” to 
constitute “urgent care” as defined under the Employ ee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as 
amended (ERISA). 
Grievance 
A grievance  is a type of oral or written complaint you make about care or service you received from Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from a provider who participates in your  health care network. This type of 
complaint concerns the service you receive or the quality of your care. It does not involve a dispute with a Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued)

review process. 
Group 
When you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , the group  is your agent and is not the agent 
of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The term “ group”  refers to the corporation, partnership, individual 
proprietorship, or other organization that has an agreement for Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide 
its enrolled group members  with access to health care services and benefits. 
Group Contract 
When you enroll in this health plan as a group  member , you are enrolled under a group  contract . If this 
applies to your coverage in this health plan, your group  eligibility, termination, and continuation of 
coverage provisions are described in Part 11 of this Subscriber Certificate. Under a group  contract , the 
subscriber’s  group  has an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide the subscriber  and 
their enrolled dependents with access to health care services and benefits. The group  will make payments 
to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for coverage in this health plan for its enrolled group  members . The 
group  should also deliver to its group  members  all notices from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The 
group  is the subscriber’s  agent and is not the agent of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . A group  contract  
includes: this Subscriber Certificate; the Schedule of Benefits for your plan option; any riders  or other 
changes to the group  contract ; the subscriber’s  enrollment form; and the agreement that Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  has with the subscriber’s group  to provide coverage for the subscriber  and their enrolled 
dependents. This Subscriber Certificate is not a contract between you and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue. The group  contract  will be governed by and construed acco rding to the laws of the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts, except as preempted by federal law. 
You hereby expressly acknowledge your understanding that the group  contract  constitutes a contract solely 
between your group  on your behalf and Blue Cross and Blue  Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. 
(Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ), which is a corporation independent of and operating under a license 
from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an a ssociation of independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Plans (the “Association”), permitting Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to use the Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield Service Marks in the Commonw ealth of Massachusetts, and that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
is not contracting as the agent of the Associa tion. You further acknowledge and agree that your group  on 
your behalf has not entered into the group  contract  based upon representations by any person other than 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and that no person, entity, or organization other than Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will be held accountable or  liable to you or your group  on your behalf for any of Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  obligations to you created under the group  contract . This paragraph will 
not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the part of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  other 
than those obligations created under other provisions of the group  contract . 
Individual Contract 
When you enroll in this health plan  directly as an individual, you are enrolled for coverage under an 
individual contract . (This means that you did not enroll for coverage in this health plan as a group member .) 
If this applies to your coverage in this health plan, your eligibility and termination provisions are described 
in Part 12 of this Subscriber Certificate. Under an individual contract , the subscriber  has an agreement 
directly with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide the subscriber  and their enrolled dependents 
with access to health care services and benefits. The subscriber  will make payments to Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  for coverage in this health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send notices to 
the subscriber . An individual contract  includes: this Subscriber Certificate; the Schedule of Benefits for Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 17 your plan option; any riders  or other changes to the individual  contract ; and the subscriber’s  enrollment 
form. The individual  contract  will be governed by and constr ued according to the laws of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, except as preempted by federal law. 
Important Note:  If you enroll in this health plan as an individual  member  through the Massachusetts Health 
Connector, the subscriber  has an agreement with the Health Connector. The subscriber  will usually make 
payments to the Health Connector for coverage in this health plan. The Health Connector will send all 
notices to the subscriber . 
You hereby expressly acknowledge your understanding that an individual  contract  constitutes a contract 
solely between you and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO Blue, Inc. ( Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue ), which is a corporation independent of a nd operating under a license from the Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield Association, an association of in dependent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans (the 
“Association”), permitting Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service 
Marks in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not 
contracting as the agent of the Association. You fu rther acknowledge and agree that you have not entered 
into an individual  contract  based upon representations by any person other than Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  and that no person, entity, or organization other than Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will be 
held accountable or liable to you for any of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  obligations to you created 
under an individual  contract . This paragraph will not create any a dditional obligations whatsoever on the 
part of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  other than those obligations created under other provisions of the 
individual  contract . 
Inpatient 
The term “inpatient” refers to your status as a hospital patient, or as a patient in a health care facility, when 
you are admitted as a registered bed patient. Even if you stay in the hospital or health care facility overnight, 
you might still be considered an “outpatient.” Your  status is important because it affects how much you 
will pay for covered services , like x-rays, drugs, lab tests, and physician services. You are an inpatient  
starting the day you are formally admitt ed with a doctor’s order as a regist ered bed patient in a hospital or 
other health care facility. Note: You are an outpatient  when you are kept in a hospital or health care facility 
solely for observation, even though you use a bed or spend the night. Observation services are to help the 
doctor decide if a patient needs to be admitted for care or can be discharged. These services may be given 
in the emergency room or another area of the hospital. If you would normally pay a copayment  for 
outpatient  emergency medical care  or outpatient  medical care services, the copayment  will be waived when 
you are held for observation. Bu t, you must still pay your deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies. 
Medical Policy 
To receive your health plan coverage, your health care services and supplies must meet the criteria for 
coverage that are defined in each Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue medical policy  that applies. Each health 
care service or supply must also meet the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical technology assessment 
criteria . (See below.) The policies and criteria that will a pply are those that are in effect at the time you 
receive the health care service or supply. These policies are based upon Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  
assessment of the quality of the scientif ic and clinical evidence that is pub lished in peer reviewed journals. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also consider other clinical sources that are generally accepted and 
credible. (These sources may include specialty societ y guidelines, textbooks, and expert opinion.) These 
medical policies  explain Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  criteria for when a health care service or 
supply is medically necessary , or is not medically necessary , or is investigational. These policies form the 
basis of coverage decisions. A policy may not exist for each  health care service or supply. If this is the case 
for a certain health care service or supply, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may apply its medical Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 18 technology assessment criteria  and its medical necessity  criteria to determine if the health care service or 
supply is medically necessary  or if it is not medically necessary  or if it is investigational. To check for a 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical policy , you can go online and log on to the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  Web site at www.bluecrossma.org . (Your health care provider can also access a policy 
by using the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  provider Web site.) Or, you can call the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. You can ask them to mail a copy to you. 
Medical Technology Assessment Criteria 
To receive your health plan coverage, all of your  health care services and supplies must conform to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  medical technology assessment criteria . These criteria assess whether a 
technology improves health outcomes such as length of life or ability to function when performing everyday 
tasks. The medical technology assessment criteria  that apply are those that are in effect at the time you 
receive a health care service or supply. These criteria are: 
 The technology must have final approval from the appropriate government regulatory bodies. This 
criterion applies to drugs, biolog ical products, devices (such as dur able medical equipment), and 
diagnostic services. A drug, biological product, or  device must have final approval from the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Any approval granted as an interim step in the FDA regulatory 
process is not sufficient. (The FDA Humanitarian Device Exemption is one example of an interim 
step.) Except as required by law, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may limit coverage for drugs, 
biological products, and devices to those speci fic indications, conditions, and methods of use 
approved by the FDA. 
 The scientific evidence must permit conclusions c oncerning the effect of the technology on health 
outcomes. The evidence should consist of well-desi gned and well-conducted inv estigations published 
in peer-reviewed English-language journals. The qua lities of the body of studies and the consistency 
of the results are considered in evaluating the evidence. The evidence should demonstrate that the 
technology can measurably alter the physiological ch anges related to a disease, injury, illness, or 
condition. In addition, there should be eviden ce or a convincing argument based on established 
medical facts that the measured alterations affect  health outcomes. Opinions and evaluations by 
national medical associations, consensus panels, and other technology evaluation bodies are evaluated 
according to the scientific quality of the supporting evidence upon which they are based. 
 The technology must improve the net health outcome . The technology’s beneficial effects on health 
outcomes should outweigh any harmfu l effects on health outcomes. 
 The technology must be as beneficial as any estab lished alternatives. The technology should improve 
the net outcome as much as or more than establis hed alternatives. The technology must be as cost 
effective as any established alternative that achieves a similar health outcome. 
 The improvement must be attainable outside the investigational setting. When used under the usual 
conditions of medical practice, the technology s hould be reasonably expected to improve health 
outcomes to a degree comparable to that  published in the medical literature. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also, as part of a “pilot” program, cover new technologies that are 
not otherwise described as a covered service . In these cases, the technologies that are covered under the 
pilot program must: be approved by the FDA; have published clinical literature showing safety and efficacy; 
and be reasonably expected to  improve health outcomes. 
Medically Necessary (Medical Necessity) 
To receive your health plan coverage, all of  your health care services and supplies must be medically 
necessary  and appropriate for your health care needs. (T he only exceptions are for certain routine and 
preventive health care services that are covered by this health plan.) Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue has Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 19 the discretion to determine which health care services and supplies that you receive (or you are planning to 
receive) are medically necessary  and appropriate for coverage. It w ill do this by referring to the guidelines 
described below. 
All health care services must be required services that a health care provider, using prudent clinical 
judgment, would provide to a patient in  order to prevent or to evaluate or to diagnose or to treat an illness, 
injury, disease, or its symptoms. And, these health care services must also be: 
 Furnished in accordance with generally accepted standards of professional medical practice (as 
recognized by the relevant medical community); 
 Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; and they must be 
considered effective for your  illness, injury, or disease; 
 Consistent with the diagnosis and treatment  of your condition and in accordance with Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue medical policies and medical technology assessment criteria ; 
 Essential to improve your net health outcome and as beneficial as any established alternatives that are 
covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue ; 
 Consistent with the level of skilled services that are furnished and furnished in the least intensive type 
of medical care setting that is requi red by your medical condition; and 
 Not more costly than an alterna tive service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce the 
same therapeutic or diagnostic results to dia gnose or treat your illness, injury, or disease. 
This does not include a service that: is primarily for your convenience or for the convenience of your family 
or the health care provider; is furnished solely for your religious preference; promotes athletic achievements 
or a desired lifestyle; improves your appearance or how you feel about your appearance; or increases or enhances your environmental or personal comfort. 
Member 
The term “you” refers to any member  who has the right to the coverage  provided by this health plan. A 
member  may be the subscriber  or their enrolled eligible spouse (or former spouse, if applicable) or any 
other enrolled eligible dependent. 
Mental Conditions 
This health plan provides coverage for treatment  of psychiatric illnesses or diseases. These include 
substance use disorders (such as drug and alcohol addiction). The illnesses or diseases that qualify as mental 
conditions  are listed in the latest edition, at the time you  receive treatment, of the American Psychiatric 
Association’s Diagnostic and Statisti cal Manual of Mental Disorders. 
Mental Health Providers 
This health plan provides coverage for treatment of a mental condition when these covered services are 
furnished by a covered provider  who is a mental health provider. These covered providers  include any one 
or more of the following kinds of health care provi ders: alcohol and drug trea tment facilities; clinical 
specialists in psychiatric and mental health nursing; co mmunity health centers (that are a part of a general 
hospital); day care centers; detoxification facilities; ge neral hospitals; licensed alcohol and drug counselor 
I providers; licensed independent clinical social work ers; licensed marriage and family therapists; licensed 
mental health counselors; mental health centers; mental hospitals; opioid treatment program providers; 
physicians; psychiatric nurse practiti oners; psychologists; and other mental health providers  that are 
designated for you by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 20 Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Out-of-Pocket Limit) 
Under this health plan, there is a maximum cost share amount that you will have to pay for certain covered 
services . This is referred to as an “ out-of-pocket maximum .” Your ID card will show the amount of your 
out-of-pocket maximum.  The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option will show the amount of your 
out-of-pocket maximum  and the time frame for which it appli es—such as each calendar year or each plan 
year. It will also describe the cost share am ounts you pay that will count toward the out-of-pocket maximum . 
(Also refer to riders —if there are any—that apply to your coverage  in this health plan .) Once the cost share 
amounts you have paid that count toward the out-of-pocket maximum  add up to the out-of-pocket maximum  
amount, you will receive full benefits based on the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge  for 
more of these covered services  during the rest of the time frame in which the  out-of-pocket maximum  
provision applies. There are some costs that you pay that do not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum . 
These costs that do not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum  are: 
 The premium  you pay for your health plan. 
 The costs you pay when your coverage is re duced or denied because you did not follow the 
requirements of the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  utilization review  program. (See Part 4.) 
 The costs you pay that are more than the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  allowed charge . 
 The costs you pay because your health plan has pr ovided all of the benefits it allows for that covered 
service.  
Note: As required by federal law for “surprise billing,” any cost share amounts paid for certain covered 
services furnished by non- preferred providers  will contribute toward satisfying your in-network 
out-of-pocket maximum  amount. (See Part 2, “Allowed Charge” for an explanation of these services.)  
See the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option for other costs that you may have to pay that do not count 
toward your out-of-pocket maximum . 
The out-of-pocket maximum  is indexed to the average national premium growth and the amount may be 
increased annually. This means that your  out-of-pocket maximum  amount may increase from time to time, 
as determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you if 
this happens. However, the amount of your out-of-pocket maximum  will never be more than the maximum 
out-of-pocket maximum  amount allowed under applicable law. 
Outpatient 
The term “outpatient” refers to your status as a patie nt. Your status is important because it affects how 
much you will pay for covered services . You are an outpatient  if you are getting emergency room services, 
observation services, outpatient day surgery, or other hospital services such as lab tests or x-rays and the 
doctor has not written an order to admit you to  the hospital or health care facility as an inpatient . In these 
cases, you are an outpatient  even if you spend the night at the hosp ital or health care facility. You are also 
an outpatient  if you are getting covered services  at a health center, at a provider’s office (this can be either 
in-person or via telehealth), or in other covere d outpatient settings, or at home. You are also an outpatient  
if you are getting covered services  from a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue designated telehealth vendor. 
Note: You are an outpatient  when you are kept in a hospital or he alth care facility solely for observation, 
even though you use a bed or spend the night. Observation services are to help the doctor decide if a patient 
needs to be admitted for care or can  be discharged. These services may be given in the emergency room or 
another area of the hospital. If you would normally pay a copayment  for outpatient  emergency medical care  
or outpatient  medical care services, the copayment  will be waived when you are held for observation. But, 
you must still pay your deductible  and/or coinsurance , whichever applies. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 21 Plan Sponsor 
When you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , the plan sponsor  is usually your employer 
and is the same as the plan sponsor designated under  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended (ERISA). If you are a group member  and you are not sure who your plan sponsor  is, you 
should ask the subscriber’s  employer. 
Plan Year 
When your plan option includes a deductible  and/or an out-of-pocket maximum , these amounts will be 
calculated based on a calendar year or a plan year  basis. The Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option will 
show whether a calendar year or a plan year  calculation applies to your  coverage. (Also refer to riders —if 
there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health plan.) If a plan year  calculation applies, it means 
the period of time that starts on the original effective date  of your coverage in this health plan (or if you are 
enrolled in this health plan as a group member , your group’s  coverage under the group contract ) and 
continues for 12 consecutive months or until your  renewal date, whichever comes first. A new plan year  
begins each 12-month period thereafter. If you do not know when your plan year  begins, you can ask Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Or, if you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , you can ask 
your plan sponsor . 
Premium 
For coverage in this health plan, the subscriber  (or the subscriber’s group  on your behalf when you are 
enrolled in this health plan as a group  member ) will pay a monthly premium  to Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue . The total amount of your monthly premium  is provided to you in the yearly evidence of 
coverage packet that is issued by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
will provide you with access to health care services and benefits as long as the total premium  that is owed 
for your coverage in this health plan is paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  may change your premium . Each time Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  changes the premium  
for coverage in this health plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you (or the subscriber’s 
group  when you are enrolled in  this health plan as a group  member ) before the change takes place. (If you 
enrolled in this health plan throug h the Massachusetts Health Connector , see Part 11 or Part 12, whichever 
applies to you, for information.) 
Primary Care Provider 
Your PPO health care network includes physicians  (who are internists, family practitioners, or 
pediatricians), nurse practitioners, and physician assist ants that you may choose to furnish your primary 
medical care. These health care providers are generally called primary care providers . As a member  of this 
health plan, you are not required to choose a primary care provider  in order for you  to receive your health 
plan coverage. You may choose any covered provider  to furnish your health care services and supplies. 
But, your choice is important because it will impa ct the costs that you pay for your health care 
services and supplies.  Your costs will be less when you use health care providers who participate in your 
PPO health care network to furnish your covered services . 
Rider 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and/or your group  (when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group 
member ) may change the terms of your cove rage in this health plan. If a ma terial change is made to your 
coverage in this health plan, it is described in a rider . For example, a rider  may change the amount that you 
must pay for certain services such as the amount of your copayment . Or, it may add to or limit the benefits 
provided by this health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will supply you with riders  (if there are Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 22 any) that apply to your coverage in this health plan. You should keep these riders  with this Subscriber 
Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  so that you can refer to them. 
Room and Board 
For an approved inpatient  admission, covered services  include room and board . This means your room, 
meals, and general nursing services while you are an inpatient . This includes hospital services that are 
furnished in an intensive care or similar unit. 
Schedule of Benefits 
This Subscriber Certificate includes a Schedule of Benefits  for your specific plan option. It describes the 
cost share amount that you must pay for each covered service (such as a deductible , a copayment , or a 
coinsurance ). And, it includes important information about your deductible  and out-of-pocket maximum . It 
also describes benefit limits  that apply for certain covered services . Be sure to read all parts of this 
Subscriber Certificate and your Schedule of Benefits  to understand your health care benefits. You should 
read the Schedule of Benefits  along with the descriptions of covered services  and the limits and exclusions 
that are described in this  Subscriber Certificate. 
A rider  may change the informati on that is shown in your Schedule of Benefits . Be sure to read each rider 
(if there is any). 
Service Area 
The service area  is the geographic area in which you may receive all of your health care services and 
supplies. Your service area  includes all counties in the Commonwea lth of Massachusetts. In addition, for 
those members  who are living or traveling outside of Massachusetts (but within the United States) this 
health plan provides access to the lo cal Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan’s PPO health care networks. 
Special Services (Hospital and Facility Ancillary Services) 
When you receive health care services from a hos pital or other covered health care facility, covered services  
include certain  services and supplies that the health care fac ility normally furnishes to its patients for 
diagnosis or treatment while the patient is in the facility. These special services  include (but are not limited 
to) such things as: 
 The use of special rooms. These include: operating rooms; and treatment rooms. 
 Tests and exams. 
 The use of special equipment in the facility. Also, the services of the people hired by the facility to 
run the equipment. 
 Drugs, medications, solutions, biological preparations, and medical and surgical supplies that are used 
while you are in the facility. 
 Administration of infusions and transfusions and blood processing fees. These do not include the cost 
of: whole blood; packed red blood cells; blood donor fees; or blood storage fees. 
 Internal prostheses (artificial replacements of parts of the body) that are part of an operation. These 
include things such as: hip joints; skull plates; intraocular lenses that are implanted after corneal 
transplant, cataract surgery, or other covered eye su rgery, when the natural eye lens is replaced; and 
pacemakers. They do not include things such as: osto my bags; artificial limbs or eyes; hearing aids; or 
airplane splints. Part 2 – Explanation of Terms  (continued)

The subscriber  is the eligible person who signs the enrollment form at the time of enro llment in this health 
plan. 
Urgent Care 
This health plan provides coverage for urgent care . This is medical, surgical, or psychiatric care, other than 
emergency medical care , that you need right away. This is care that you need to prevent serious 
deterioration of your health when an unfor eseen illness or injury o ccurs. In most cases, urgent care will be 
brief diagnostic care and treatment to stabilize your condition. (For purposes of filing a claim or a formal appeal  or grievance  review, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  considers “ emergency medical care ” to 
constitute “urgent care” as defined under the Employ ee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as 
amended (ERISA). As used in this Subscriber Certificate, this urgent care term is not the same as the 
“urgent care” term defined under ERISA.) 
Utilization Review 
This term refers to the programs that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses to evaluate the necessity and 
appropriateness of your health care services and supplies. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  uses a set of 
formal techniques that are designed to  monitor the use of, or evaluate th e clinical necessity, appropriateness, 
efficacy or efficiency of health care services, procedures or settings, and drugs. These programs are designed to encourage appropriate care and services (not less care). Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
understands the need for concern about underutilization. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue shares this 
concern with its members  and health care providers. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue does not compensate 
individuals who conduct utilization review activities based on denials. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
also does not offer incentives to h ealth care providers to encourage inappropriate denials of care and 
services. These programs may include any or all of the following: 
 Pre-admission review, concurrent review, and discharge planning. 
 Pre-approval of some outpatient  services, including drugs (whether the drugs are furnished to you by 
a health care provider along with a covered service  or by a pharmacy). 
 Drug formulary management (compliance with the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue Drug 
Formulary). This also includes quality care dosing which helps to monitor the quantity and dose of 
the drug that you receive, based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations and clinical information. 
 Step therapy to help your health care provider fu rnish you with the appropriate drug treatment. (With 
step therapy, before coverage is approved for cer tain “second step” drugs, it is required that you first 
try an effective “first step” drug.) 
 Post-payment review. 
 Individual case management. WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2.

You do not need a referral from your health care provider or an approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue before you obtain emergency medical care . As a member  of this health plan, you will receive 
worldwide emergency coverage. These em ergency medical services may include inpatient  or outpatient  
services by health care providers  who are qualified to furnish emergency medical care . This includes care 
that is needed to evaluate or stab ilize your emergency medical condition. At the onset of an emergency 
medical condition that in your judgment requires emergency medical care , you should go to the 
nearest emergency room. If you need help, dial 911. Or, call your local emergency medical service 
system phone number. You will not be denied coverage for me dical and transportation services that you 
incur as a result of your emergency medical conditi on. You usually need emergency medical services 
because of the sudden onset of an emergency medica l condition. An “emergency medical condition” is a 
medical condition, whether physical, behavioral, related to substance use, or mental, manifesting itself by 
acute symptoms of sufficient severity  (including severe pain) that, in the absence of prompt care, could 
reasonably be expected by a prudent layperson who h as an average knowledge of health and medicine to 
result in: placing your life or health or the health of  another (including an unborn child) in serious jeopardy; 
or serious impairment of bodily functions; or serious  dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or, as 
determined by a provider with knowledge of your co ndition, severe pain that cannot be managed without 
such care. Some examples of conditions that require emergency medical care  are: suspected heart attacks; 
strokes; poisoning; loss of consciousn ess; convulsions; and suicide attempts. 
Inpatient Emergency Admissions 
Your condition may require that you be admitted into a hospital for  inpatient  emergency medical care.  If 
this happens, you or the admitting facility (or someone on your behalf) must call Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  within 48 hours of your admission. (A health care facility that participates in your health care 
network should call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for you.) This call must include: your name; your 
ID number; the name of the health care facility; the date of admission; and the condition for which you are 
receiving treatment. This information is required so that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  can evaluate 
and monitor the appropriateness of your inpatient  health care services. 
Outpatient Emergency Services 
When you have an emergency medical  condition, you should receive care at the nearest emergency room. 
If you receive emergency medical care  at an emergency room of a hospital that does not participate in your 
health care network, your health plan will provide th e same coverage that you would otherwise receive if 
you had gone to a hospital that does par ticipate in your health care network. 
Post-Stabilization Care 
After your emergency medical condition has been evalua ted and stabilized in the hospital emergency room, 
you may be ready to go home. Or, you may require further care. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
consider post-stabilization covered services  to be approved if an approval is not given within 30 minutes of 
the emergency room provider’s call. If the emergenc y room provider and your health care provider do not 
agree as to the right medical treatment for you, your  health plan will cover the health care services and Part 3 – Emergency Services  (continued)

 Page 25 supplies that are recommended by the emergency room provider. But, benefits will be provided only for 
the health care services and supplies th at are covered by your health plan. 
 Admissions from the Emergency Room. Your condition may require that  you be admitted directly 
from the emergency room into that hospital for  inpatient  emergency medical care.  If this happens, 
you or the admitting facility (or so meone on your behalf) must call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue. (A health care facility that participates in your health care network should call Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  for you.) This call must be made within 48 hours of your admission. This call must 
include: your name; your ID number;  the name of the health care f acility; the date of admission; and 
the condition for which you are receiving treatment. This is required so that Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  can evaluate and monitor the appropriateness of your inpatient  health care services.  
 Transfers to Other Inpatient Facilities.  Your emergency room pr ovider may recommend your 
transfer to another facility for inpatient  care. If this happens, you or the admitting facility (or someone 
on your behalf) must call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (A health care facility that participates 
in your health care network should call Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for you.) This call must be 
made within 48 hours of your admission. This is required so that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
can evaluate the appropriateness of the inpatient health care services. 
 Outpatient Follow Up Care.  Your emergency room provide r may recommend that you have 
outpatient  follow up care. If this happens, the emergency room provider must call Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  to obtain an approval when the type of care that you need requires an approval 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (See Part 4.) If you need to have more follow up care and an 
approval is required, you or your health care provider must obtain the approval from Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue .

Utilization Review Requirements 
To receive all of the coverage provided by your hea lth plan, you must follow all of the requirements 
described in this section. Your coverage may be denied if you do not follow these requirements.  
Pre-Service Approval Requirements 
There are certain health care services or s upplies that must be approved for you by Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue . A health care provider who participates in your health care network should request a pre-service 
approval on your behalf. (You must requ est this review if the health care provider does not start the process 
for you.) For the pre-service review, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will consider your health care 
provider to be your authorized representative. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will tell you and your 
health care provider if coverage for a proposed s ervice has been approved or if coverage has been 
denied.  To check on the status of a request or to check for the outcome of a utilization review  decision, you 
can call your health care provider or the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The 
toll free phone number to call is shown on your ID car d. Remember, you should check with your health 
care provider before you receive services or suppli es to make sure that your health care provider  has 
received approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  when a pre-service approval is required. 
Otherwise, you will have to pay all charges fo r those health care services and/or supplies. 
(The requirements described below in this part do not apply to your covered services  when Medicare is the 
primary coverage.) 
Referrals for Specialty Care 
You do not need a referral from your primary care provider  or your attending physician in order for you to 
receive your health plan coverage. But, there are cer tain health care services a nd supplies that must be 
approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  before you receive them. (See below.) 
Pre-Service Review for Outpatient Services 
To receive all of your coverage for certain outpatient  health services and supplies, you must obtain a 
pre-service approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . A provider who participates in your health 
care network will request this approval on your  behalf. During the pre-service review, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will determine if your proposed health care services or supplies should be covered as 
medically necessary  for your condition. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this decision within 
two working days of the date that it receives all of the needed information from your health care provider. 
You must receive a pre-service approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for: 
 Certain outpatient  specialty care, procedures, services, a nd supplies. Some examples of services that 
may require prior approval include: some types of  surgery; non-emergency ground ambulance; and 
certain outpatient  treatment plans that require a review due to factors such as (but not limited to) the 
variability in length of treatment, the difficulty in predicting a standard length of treatment, the risk 
factors and provider discretion in determining tr eatment intensity compared to symptoms, the 
difficulty in measuring outcomes, or  the variability in cost and quality. To find out if a treatment, 
service, or supply needs a pre-service review, you can check with your health care provider. 
You can also find out by calling the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office or 
using the online Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  member self service option. To check online, Part 4 – Utilization Review Requirements  (continued)

the steps to check your benefits.  
 Infertility treatment. 
 Certain prescription drugs that you buy from a pha rmacy or that are administered to you by a 
non-pharmacy health care provider during a covered vis it. For example, you receive an injection or an 
infusion of a drug in a physician’s office or in a hospital outpatient setting. A key part of this 
pre-service approval process is the step therapy progr am. It helps your health care provider provide 
you with the appropriate drug treatment. To find out if your prescription drug requires a prior approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
customer service office. 
From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may change the list of health care services and 
supplies that require a prior approval. When a ma terial change is made to these requirements, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let the subscriber  (or the subscriber’s  group  on your behalf when you are 
enrolled in this health plan as a  group member ) know about the change at leas t 60 days before the change 
becomes effective. 
Missing Information 
In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will need more information or records to determine if 
your proposed health care services or supplies should be covered as medically necessary  to treat your 
condition. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may ask for the results of a face-to-face clinical 
evaluation or of a second opinion. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  does need more information, Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for this missing information or  records within 15 calendar days of 
the date that it received your health care provider’s re quest for pre-service approval. The information or 
records that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  asks for must be provided to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue within 45 calendar days of the request. If this information or these record s are not provided to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within these 45 calendar days, your pr oposed coverage will be denied. If Blue

Pre-Admission Review 
Before you go into a hospital or othe r covered health care facility for inpatient  care, your health care 
provider must obtain an approval from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  in order for your care to be 
covered by this health plan. (This does not apply to your admission if it is for emergency medical care  or 
for maternity care.) Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will determine if the health care setting is suitable 
to treat your condition. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this decision within two working days 
of the date that it receives all of the needed inform ation from your health care provider. Any pre-admission

above in this section. 
Exception: If your admission is for substance use treatment in a hospital or other covered health care 
facility that is certified or licensed  by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, prior approval from 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not be required. For an admission in one of these health care 
facilities, coverage will be provided for medically necessary  acute treatment services and clinical 
stabilization services for up to a total of 14 days with out prior approval, as long as the health care facility 
notifies Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and provides the initial treatment plan within 48 hours of your

admissions (except as described in the paragra ph above), you must have prior approval from Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  in order for your inpatient  care to be covered by this health plan. 
Missing Information 
In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will need more information or records to determine if the

and review the health care services you receive to make sure you still need inpatient  coverage in that facility. 
In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may determine upon review that  you will need to continue

approved for coverage (or the next review date); th e new total number of appr oved days or services; and 
the date the approved services will begin. 
In other cases, based on a medical necessity  determination, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may

need inpatient  coverage at all. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this decision within one Part 4 – Utilization Review Requirements  (continued)

care facility to let them know of this decision. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will discuss plans for 
continued coverage in a health care setting that better meets your needs. Th is phone call will be made within 
24 hours of the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  coverage decision. For example, your condition may no 
longer require inpatient  coverage in a hospital, but it still may require skilled nursing coverage. If this is 
the case, your physician may decide to transfer you to a skilled nursing facility. Any proposed plans will 
be discussed with you by your physicia n. All arrangements for discharge  planning will be confirmed in 
writing with you. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send this written (or electronic) notice to you and 
to the facility within one working day of that phone call to the facility. You may choose to stay in the health 
care facility after you have been told by your health care provider  or Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
that inpatient  coverage is no longer medically  necessary . But, if you do, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
will not provide any more coverage (except as otherwise may be required  during the formal review process). 
You must pay all costs for the rest of that inpatient  stay. This starts from the date the written notice is sent 
to you from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
Reconsideration of Adverse Determination 
Your health care provider may ask that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  reconsider its decision when 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has determined that continued inpatient  coverage is not medically 
necessary for your condition. In this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will arrange for the decision 
to be reviewed by a clinical peer reviewer. This re view will be held between yo ur health care provider and 
the clinical peer reviewer. And, it will be held with in one working day of the date that your health care 
provider asks for the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decision to be reconsidered. If the initial decision

to ask for a formal review is described in Part 10 of this Subscriber Certificate. You may request a formal 
review even if your health care provider has not asked that the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decision

Individual Case Management 
Individual Case Management is a flexible program for managing your benefits in some situations. Through 
this program, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  works with your health care providers to make sure that 
you get medically necessary  services in the least intensive setti ng that meets your needs. Under this 
program, coverage may be a pproved for services that are in addition to those that are already covered by 
this health plan. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may approve these services to: 
 Shorten an inpatient  stay. This may occur by sending a member  home or to a less intensive setting to 
continue treatment. 
 Direct a member  to a less costly setting when an inpatient  stay has been proposed. 
 Prevent future inpatient  stays. This may occur by providing coverage for outpatient  care instead. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may, in some situations, present a sp ecific alternative treatment plan to 
you and your attending physician. This treatment plan will be one that is medically necessary  for you. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will need the full cooperation of everyone  involved. This includes: the patient 
(or the guardian); the hospital; the attending physic ian; and the proposed health care provider. Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  may require that there be a written agreem ent between the patient (or the patient’s 
family or guardian) and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also 
require that there be an agreement between the health care provider and Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
to furnish the services that are approved th rough this alternative treatment plan.

Covered Services 
You have the right to the coverage described in this pa rt, except as limited or excluded in other parts of this 
Subscriber Certificate. Also, be sure to read the Schedule of Benefits  for your plan option. It describes the 
cost share amounts that you must pay for covered services . And, it shows the benefit limits  that apply to 
specific covered services . (Also refer to riders —if there are any—that apply to your coverage in this health 
plan.) Your coverage in this health plan consists of  two benefit levels: one for in-network benefits; 
and one for out-of-network benefits.  This means that your cost share amount differs based on the benefit 
level of the covered services  that you receive. The highest benef it level is provided when you receive 
covered services from a covered provider  who participates in your PPO hea lth care network. This is your 
in-network benefit level. The lowest benefit level is usually provided when you receive covered services 
from a covered provider  who does not participate in your PPO h ealth care network. This is your out-of-
network benefit level. Your out-of-netwo rk benefit level will be at least 80%  of the in-network benefit level. 
This means that the coinsurance  percentage for out-of-network benefits  for non-emergency covered 
services  will be no more than 20 percentage points greater than the coinsurance  percentage for in-network 
benefits  for the same covered services  (excluding any reasonable deductible  or copayment ). The Schedule 
of Benefits for your plan option shows the cost share amounts that you will pay for in-network benefits and 
for out-of-network benefits.

Intermediate Treatments 
There may be times when you  will need medically necessary  care that is more intensive than typical

 Acute residential treatment (this is substantia lly similar to Community-Based Acute Treatment 
(CBAT) programs described below in this section) , clinically managed detoxification services, or 
crisis stabilization services. These services may someti mes be referred to as sub-acute care services. 
These services offer 24 hours a day, 7 days a week access to medical services and on-site or on-call nursing staff. Your coverage for these services is considered to be an inpatient  benefit. During the

by a CBAT program, including more frequent psychi atric and psychopharmacological evaluation and 
treatment and more intensive staffing and servi ce delivery. This may be delivered through an 
Intensive Community-Based Acute Treatment (ICBAT) program. ICBAT programs may admit

members with clinical symptoms that are similar to those which would be treated under inpatient  
mental health care but who are able to be cared for safely in an unlocked setting. Your coverage for 
these CBAT and ICBAT programs is considered to be an inpatient  benefit. During the inpatient  
pre-service review process (see Part 4), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will assess your specific 
health care needs. The least intensive ty pe of setting that is required for your mental condition  will be 
approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (These CBAT and ICBAT programs are

telehealth cost share that you would pay for covered services  furnished by a preferre d primary care provider 
type that is not a virtual care team primary care provider type as described in your Schedule of Benefits  
and/or riders  that apply to your coverage in this health plan. When you are enrolled in an Options tiered

Other Party Liability 
Coordination of Benefits (COB) 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will coordinate payment of covered services  with hospital, medical, 
dental, health, or other plans under which you are covered. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will do this 
to make sure that the cost of your health care servi ces is not paid more than once. Other plans include: 
personal injury insurance; autom obile insurance, including medical payments coverage; homeowner’s 
insurance; and other plans that cover hospital or medical expenses. 
You must include information on your enrollment fo rms about all other health plans under which you are 
covered. Once you are enrolled in this health plan, you must notify Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  if 
you add or change health  plan coverage. Upon Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  request, you must also 
supply Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  with information about other plans that may provide you with 
coverage for health care services. 
Under COB, the plan that provides benefits first is known as the primary payor. And the plan(s) that provide 
benefits next are known as the secondary payor(s). When  coverage in this health plan is secondary, no 
coverage will be provided until afte r the primary payor determines its share, if any, of the liability. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decides which is the primary a nd secondary payor. To do this, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  relies on Massachusetts law, including the COB regulations issued by the 
Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A copy of these rules is available from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue upon request. Unless otherwise requi red by law, coverage in this h ealth plan will be secondary when 
another plan provides you with coverage for health care services. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not provide any more coverage  than what is described in this 
Subscriber Certificate. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not provide duplicate benefits for covered 
services . If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  pays more than the amount that it should have under COB, 
then you must give that amount back to  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue has the right to get that amount back from you or any appropriate person, insurance company, or other 
organization. 
Important Notice: If you fail to comply with the provisions of  this COB section, payment of your claim 
may be denied. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  Rights to Recover Benefit Payments 
Subrogation and Reimbursement of Benefit Payments 
If you are injured by any act or omission of another pe rson, the benefits under this health plan will be 
subrogated. This means that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may use your right to recover money from 
the person(s) who caused the injury or from any insu rance company or other party. If you recover money, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is entitled to recover up to the amount  of the benefit payments that it 
has made. This is true no matter where or by whom the recovered money is held or  how it is designated and 
even if you do not recover the total amount of your clai m against the other person(s). This is also true if the 
payment you receive is described as payment for other than health care expenses. The amount that you must 
reimburse to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not be reduced by any atto rney’s fees or expenses that 
you incur. Part 7 – Other Party Liability (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 75 Member Cooperation 
You must give Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  information and help. This means you must complete 
and sign all necessary documents to help Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  get this money back. This also 
means that you must give  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  timely notice of all significant steps during 
negotiation, litigation, or settlement with any third pa rty (such as filing a claim or lawsuit, initiation of 
settlement discussions, agreement to a settlement in pr inciple, etc.) and before settling any claim arising 
out of injuries you sustained by an act or omission of another person(s) for which Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  paid benefits. You must not do anything that might limit Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  
right to full reimbursement. 
Workers’ Compensation 
No benefits are provided for health care services that  are furnished to treat an illness or injury that Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines was work related. This is  the case even if you have an agreement 
with the workers’ compensation carrier that releas es them from paying for the claims. All employers 
provide their employees with workers’ compensation or similar insurance. This is done to protect 
employees in case of a work-related illn ess or injury. All health care cl aims for a work-related illness or 
injury must be billed to the employer’s workers’ comp ensation carrier. It is up to you to use the workers’ 
compensation insurance. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  pays for any work-related health care 
services, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has the right to get paid back from the party that legally must 
pay for the health care claims. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  also has the right, where possible, to 
reverse payments made to providers. 
If you have recovered any benefits from a workers’ compensation insurer (or from an employer liability 
plan), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has the right to recover from you the amount of benefits it has 
paid for your health care serv ices. This is the case even if: 
 the workers’ compensation benefits are in dis pute or are made by means of a settlement or 
compromise; 
 no final determination is made that  an injury or illness was sustaine d in the course of or resulted from 
your employment; 
 the amount of workers’ compensation due to medical or health care is not agreed upon or defined by 
you or the workers’ compensation carrier; or 
 the medical or health care benefits are speci fically excluded from the workers’ compensation 
settlement or compromise. 
If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is billed in error for these services, you must promptly call or write to 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office.

Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not liable for the acts or omissions by any individuals or institutions

WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 77 provider does not act as an agent on behalf of or for Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . And, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  does not act as an agent for health care pr oviders who participate in your health care 
network and have paym ent agreements with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or for any other health care 
providers. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not interfere with the relati onship between health care providers 
and their patients. You are free to select or discharge any health care provider. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue is not responsible if a provider refuses to furnish services to you. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
does not guarantee that you will be admitted to any fac ility or that you will get a special type of room or 
service. If you are admitted to a facility, you will be s ubject to all of its requirements. This includes its 
requirements on admission, discharge, and the availability of services. 
Assignment of Benefits 
You cannot assign any benefit or monies due from this h ealth plan to any person, corporation, or other 
organization without Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  written consent. Any assignment by you will be 
void. Assignment means the transfer of your rights to th e benefits provided by this health plan to another 
person or organization. There is one exception. If Me dicaid has already paid the health care provider, you 
can assign your benefits to Medicaid. 
Authorized Representative and Legal Representative 
You may choose to have another pers on act on your behalf concerning your health care coverage in this 
health plan. Some examples are a designated au thorized representative or a documented legal 
representative. An authorized representative is a person yo u have chosen to help wi th your health care issues 
and to whom Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue is allowed to disclose and discuss your protected health 
information (PHI). An authorized representative is not a person who has legal authority to act on your 
behalf. A legal representative is a person who has legal authority to act on your behalf in making decisions 
about your health care. They may be someone who has legal authority for: power of attorney for health 
care; guardianship; conservatorship; executor of estat e; or health care proxy. A legal representative may 
also be a person documented through a court order to act on your behalf in making decisions about your 
health care. To designate an authorized representa tive or document a legal representative, you must let Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  know in writing by completing the appropria te form(s). To get copies of these 
forms, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The toll free phone 
number to call is shown on your ID card. You may also log on to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
Web site at www.bluecrossma.org  to get a copy of these forms. In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  may consider your health care facility or your ph ysician or other health care provider to be your 
authorized representative. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may tell your hospital that a 
proposed inpatient  admission has been approved. Or, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may ask your 
physician for more information if more is needed for Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to make a decision. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will consider the health care provider to be your authorized 
representative for emergency medical care . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will continue to send benefit 
payments and written communicati ons regarding your health care coverage according to Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue’s  standard practices, unless you specifically ask Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to do 
otherwise. 
Changes to Health Plan Coverage 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may change the provisions  of your coverage in this health plan. (When 
you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , the plan sponsor  may also change a part of the 
group  contract .) For example, a change may be made to the cost share amount that you must pay for certain Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 78 covered services  such as your copayment  or your deductible  or your coinsurance . When Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  makes  a material change to your c overage in this health plan,  Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will send a notice about the change at least 60 days before the effective date of the change. The 
notice will be sent to the subscriber  or, when you are enrolled in this health plan as a group member , to the 
plan sponsor . The notice from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will describe the change being made. It 
will also give the effective date  of the change. If you are enrolled as a group member , the plan sponsor  
should deliver to its group  members  all notices from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . (If you enrolled in 
this health plan through the Massac husetts Health Connector, see Part 11 or Part 12, whichever applies to 
you, for information.) 
There may be times when the provisions of your coverage in this health plan change but Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  is not able to provide prior notice of th e change as described above. These changes may 
be made by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as a result of events beyond its control such as: war; riot; 
national emergency; terrorist attack; public health em ergency; pandemic; or natural disaster. When this 
happens, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a determination to provide services under this health 
plan based on the severity of the event and the needs of its members  enrolled under this health plan during 
this time. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may temporarily eliminate the cost share amount 
that you must pay for certain covered services  such as your copayment  or your deductible  or your 
coinsurance . 
Charges for Non-Medically Necessary Services 
You may receive health care services that would otherw ise be covered by this health plan, except that these 
services are not determined to be medically necessary  for you by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . This 
health plan does not cover health car e services or supplies that are not medically necessary  for you. If you 
receive care that is not medically necessary  for you, you might be charged for the care by the health care 
provider. A provider who has a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has agreed not 
to charge you for services that are not medically necessary , unless you were told, knew, or reasonably 
should have known before you receive d this treatment that it was not medically necessary . 
Clinical Guidelines and Utilization Review Criteria 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue applies medical technology assessment criteria and medical necessity 
guidelines when it develops its clinical guidelines, utili zation review criteria, and medical policies. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue reviews its clinical guide lines, utilization review criteria, and medical policies 
from time to time. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue do es this to reflect new treatments, applications, and 
technologies. For example, when a new drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue reviews its safety, eff ectiveness, and overall value on an ongoing basis. 
While a new treatment, technology, or drug is being re viewed, it will not be covered by this health plan. 
Another example is when services and supplies are a pproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the diagnosis and treatment of insulin de pendent, insulin using, gestational, or non-insulin 
dependent diabetes. In this case, coverage will be pr ovided for those services or supplies as long as they 
can be classified under a category of covered services. 
Continuity of Care Access for Cancer and Pediatric Facilities 
When you enroll in a tiered network plan under a group contract  and your group  is a small employer 
group , you may be eligible for continuity of care covera ge if you are receiving an active course of care for Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 79 a serious illness that you began before your effective date  in the tiered network plan. To be eligible for this 
continuity of care coverage, you must meet all of the following conditions: 
 You began an active course of care for a serious  illness (such as cancer or cystic fibrosis) at a 
comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility  on or after May 1, 2012 but before your effective date  in 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  tiered network plan. A “comprehensive cancer or pediatric 
facility” means: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Bo ston Children’s Hospital, Shriners Hospitals for 
Children (Boston and Springfield),  Nashoba Valley Medical Center, and Massachusetts Eye and Ear 
Infirmary. 
 You would normally pay the highest in-network cost share amount for covered services  furnished at 
the comprehensive cancer or pediatric fac ility where you are receiving your care; or the 
comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility is not in the health plan’s network. 
 Your active course of care, if it were disrupted, would cause you an undue hardship. This means, for 
example, a disruption could endanger your life, or cause you suffering or pain, or result in a substantial change to your treatment plan.  
If you meet all of the conditions stat ed above, you are eligible for this coverage until the end of the 12-month 
period that starts on the subscriber’s effective date  in the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  tiered network 
plan, but only when  your group  offers you a choice to enroll only in a tiered network plan in which your 
comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility is at the high est cost share level or it is not part of the health 
plan’s network; and your care is not available from another provider in the health plan’s network. If you 
think you are eligible for this coverage, you or your health care provider must send a completed continuity 
of care form to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . You can get a copy of this  form by calling customer 
service at the toll free phone number that is s hown on your ID card. Or, you can log on to the Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  Web site at www.bluecrossma.org . Just follow the steps to request a form. 
If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines you are eligible for this  coverage, your cost share amount 
will be at the second highest in-network cost share leve l when the comprehensive cancer or pediatric facility 
is at the highest cost share level. Or, your cost shar e amount will be at the lowest in-network cost share 
level when the comprehensive cancer or pediatric facil ity is not part of the health plan’s network. If Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  determines you are not eligible for this  coverage, you must pay the cost share 
amount you would normally pay for covered services  furnished at a comprehensive cancer or pediatric 
facility.  
Disagreement with Recommended Treatment 
When you enroll for coverage in this health plan, you  agree that it is up to your health care provider to 
decide the right treatment for your care. You may (for personal or religious reasons) refuse to accept the

a health care provider judges does not meet generally accepted standards of professional medical care. You 
have the right to refuse the treatment advice of the he alth care provider. Or, you have the right to seek other 
care at your own expense. If you want a second opinio n about your care, you have the right to coverage for 
second and third opinions. (See Part 5.) 
Mandates for Residents or Services Outside of Massachusetts

improve the quality of health care and the services that are provided to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue

also helps to identify high-risk members  and helps to assess their ongoing needs. 
 Congestive heart failure disease manage ment, education, and monitoring. 
Services Furnished by Non-Preferred Providers 
As a member  of this health plan, you will usually receive th e highest benefit level (your in-network benefits) 
only when you obtain covered services  from a covered provider  who participates in your PPO health care 
network. There are a few times when this hea lth plan will provide in-network benefits for covered services  
you receive from a covered provider  who does not participate in your PPO network. These times are 
described below in this section. If you receive covered services  from a covered provider  who does not 
participate in your PPO health care networ k, you will receive in-network benefits only when : 
 You receive emergency medical care.  
 You receive services to diagnose or treat the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). See Part 5, 
“COVID-19 Testing and Treatment” for your coverage for these services. 
 You receive covered services  that are not reasonably available from a preferred  provider  (see 
“covered provider ” in Part 2 of this Subscriber Cer tificate) and you had prior approval from Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to obtain these covered services . Or, you receive covered services  from 
a covered provider  before a preferred network is estab lished for that type of provider. Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 81  You are traveling outside of Massachusetts and you receive covered services  from a type of covered 
provider  for which the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan has not, in the opinion of Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue , established an adequate PPO health care network. 
 You receive medically necessary covered services while you are at a preferred hospital or other 
preferred facility and you do not have a r easonable opportunity to choose to have your covered 
services furnished by a preferred provider.  For example, you receive  covered services  from a 
non-preferred hospital-based anesthetist, pathologis t, or radiologist while you are at a preferred 
hospital. 
 You receive certain covered services  that are protected from surprise billing as described in Part 2. 
(See “Allowed Charge” for more information.) 
 You are a newly enrolled group  member who is having an ongoing course of treatment from a 
physician (or a primary care provider that is a nur se practitioner or physician assistant) who does not 
participate in your health care network, and your group  only offers its employees a choice of health 
insurance plans in which your ph ysician (or your primary care provi der that is a nurse practitioner or 
physician assistant) does not participate as a covered provider . In this case, this health plan will 
provide coverage for covered services  you get from that health care provider up to 30 days from your 
effective date  or, for a member who is in the second or third trimest er of pregnancy, up through the 
first post-partum visit or, for a member  with a terminal illness, until the member’s  death. (For a 
member with a terminal illness, this c overage is provided only when the member  is expected to live 
six months or less as determined by a physician.) 
This health plan will also provide in-network bene fits in the event Medicare is your primary payor (as 
allowed by federal law) and you receive covered services  from a non- preferred provider  outside of 
Massachusetts and that provider accepts Medicare assignmen t, whether or not the provider participates with 
the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. (M edicare assignment is an agreement by the provider to 
accept the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full for services furnished.) 
When Your Provider Disenrolls (or is In voluntarily Disenrolled) From the Network 
If your provider disenrolls from the network for a reason other than a quality-related reason or fraud, this 
health plan will provide coverage for covered services  that you receive from a health care provider who 
does not participate in your health care network. As re quired by law, this conti nuity of care coverage is 
described below in this section. If you receive covered services  from a covered health care provider who 
does not participate in your health care network, you may receive coverage from this health plan only when : 
 Your provider disenrolls from your health care network and you are a member  who is receiving 
covered services  for the situations listed below. If this is  the case, this health plan will notify you  that 
the health care provider is no longer part of the health care network. 
 You are undergoing a course of treatment for a serious and complex condition; you are 
undergoing a course of institutional or inpatient care; or you are scheduled to undergo 
non-elective surgery (including postoperative care) . This health plan will also notify you  of your 
right to request to continue to have benefits provided for covered services  from that health care 
provider for up to 90 days after the provider di senrolls from your health care network or when the 
course of treatment is completed, whichever comes first. 
 You are pregnant and undergoing a course of treatme nt for the pregnancy. This health plan will 
also notify you  of your right to request to conti nue to have benefits provided for covered services  
from that health care provider for up to 90 days after the provider disenrolls from your health care network or  through your first post-partum vi sit, whichever is longer. 
 You are determined to be terminally ill.  This health plan will also notify you  of your right to 
request to continue to ha ve benefits provided for covered services  from that health care provider 
for as long as the covered services  are needed. Part 8 – Other Health Plan Provisions  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 82  Your provider  is involuntarily disenrolled from your health care network and you are a member who 
is in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. In th is case, this health plan will provide coverage for 
covered services  you get from that health care provider for your pregnancy up through the first 
post-partum visit. 
 Your provider  is involuntarily disenrolled from your health care network and you are a member with 
a terminal illness. In this case, this health plan will provide coverage for covered services you get 
from that health care provider for the terminal illn ess. (This coverage is continued only when the 
terminally ill member  is expected to live six months or less as determined by a physician.) 
Services in a Disaster 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  is not liable if events beyond its control—such as war, riot, national 
emergency, terrorist attack, public health emergency, pandemic, or natural disaster—cause delay or failure 
of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to arrange for or coordinate access to  health care services and coverage 
for its members . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a good faith effort to arrange for or to 
coordinate health care services to be furnished in these situations. 
There may be times when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  provides coverage for services and/or supplies 
due to events beyond its control that are not described  in this Subscriber Certificate. (See “Changes to 
Health Plan Coverage” in this Part 8 for more information.) 
Time Limit for Legal Action 
Before you pursue a legal action against Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for any claim under this health 
plan, you must complete the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internal formal review. (See Part 10.) You 
may, but you do not need to, complete an external review before you pursue a legal action. If, after you 
complete the formal review, you choos e to bring a legal action against Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , 
you must bring this action within two years after the cause of the action arises. For example, if you are 
filing a legal action because you were denied a service or  you were denied a claim for coverage from this 
health plan, you will lose your right to bring a legal action against Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  unless 
you file your action within two years after the date of the decision of the final internal appeal  of the service 
or claim denial.

 Page 83 Part 9  
Filing a Claim 
When the Provider Files a Claim 
The health care provider will file a claim for you when you receive a covered service  from a covered 
provider  who has a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . Or, for covered services  
you receive outside of Massachusetts, a health care pr ovider will file a claim for you when they have a 
payment agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue  Shield Plan. Just tell the health care provider that 
you are a member  and show the health care provider your ID card.  Also, be sure to give the health care 
provider any other information that is needed to file  your claim. You must properly inform your health care 
provider within 30 days after you receive the covered service . If you do not, coverage will not have to be 
provided. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will pay the health care provider directly for covered services  
when the provider has a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue or with the local Blue 
Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. (When you are outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Gl obal Core Service Center has arranged your inpatient  admission, 
the hospital should file the claim for you. In this  case, the hospital will usually bill you only for your 
deductible  and/or your copayment  and/or your coinsurance , whichever applies. But, if you paid the 
hospital’s actual charge in full at the time of the ser vice, you must submit a claim as described in the section 
below.) 
When the Member Files a Claim 
You may have to file your claim when you receive a covered service  from a covered provider  who does not 
have a payment agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or a covered provider  outside of 
Massachusetts who does not have a payment agreement w ith the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. 
The health care provider may ask you to pay the entire charge  at the time of the visit or at a later time. It is 
up to you to pay your health care provider. To file a claim to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for 
repayment, you must: 
 Fill out a claim form; 
 Attach your original itemized bills; and 
 Mail the claim to the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. 
You can get claim forms from the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. (See Part 1.) 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will mail to you all forms that you will need within 15 days after 
receiving notice that you obtained some service or supply for which you may be paid. 
When you receive covered services  outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, you 
must file your claim to the Blue Cross Blue Shield  Global Core Service Center. (The Blue Cross Blue 
Shield Global Core Claim Form you receive from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will include the 
address to mail your claim.) You can get help with filing your claim by calling the service center at 1-800-810-BLUE . 
You must file a claim within two years of the date you received the covered service . Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will not have to provide coverage for services and/or supplies for which a claim is submitted 
after this two-year period. Part 9 – Filing a Claim  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 84 Timeliness of Claim Payments 
Within 30 calendar days after Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  receives a completed request for coverage 
or payment, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision. When appropriate, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will make a payment to the health care provide r (or to you in certain situations) for your 
claim to the extent of your coverage in this health plan. Or, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send 
you and/or the health care provider a notice in writing of w hy your claim is not being paid in full or in part. 
Missing Information 
If the request for coverage or payment is not complete or if Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  needs more 
information to make a final determination for your claim, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for 
the information or records it needs. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make this request within 
30 calendar days of the date that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  received the request for coverage or 
payment. This additional info rmation must be provided to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within 
45 calendar days of this request. 
 Missing Information Received Within 45 Days.  If the additional information is provided to Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within 45 calendar days of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  request, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision within the time remaining in the original 
30-day claim determination period. Or, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make the decision 
within 15 calendar days of the date that  the additional information is received by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue , whichever is later. 
 Missing Information Not Received Within 45 Days.  If the additional information is not provided to 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  within 45 calendar days of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  
request, the claim for coverage or payment will be denied by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . If 
the additional information is submitted to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  after these 45 days, then 
it may be viewed by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  as a new claim for coverage or payment. In 
this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will make a decision within 30 days as described 
previously in this section.

 Page 85 Part 10  
Appeal and Grievance Program 
You have the right to a full and fair review wh en you disagree with a decision that is made by Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  to deny a request for coverage or paym ent for services; or you disagree with how 
your claim was paid; or you are denied coverage in th is health plan; or your coverage is canceled or 
discontinued by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for reasons other than nonpayment of premium . You 
also have the right to a full and fair review when you have a complaint about the care or service you received 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from a provider who participates in your health care network. 
Part 10 explains the process for handli ng these types of problems and concerns. 
When making a determination under this health plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has full 
discretionary authority to interpret this Subscriber Ce rtificate and to determine whether a health service or 
supply is a covered service  under this health plan. All determinations by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue 
with respect to benefits under this health plan will be conclusive and binding unless it can be shown that 
the interpretation or determinati on was arbitrary and capricious. 
Inquiries and/or Claim Problems or Concerns 
Most problems or concerns can be handled with just  one phone call. For help to resolve a problem or 
concern,  you should first call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. The toll free 
phone number to call is shown on your ID card. A cu stomer service representative will work with you to 
help you understand your coverage or to resolv e your problem or concern as quickly as possible. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will consider all aspects of the particular case when resolving a problem 
or concern. This includes looking at: all of the provi sions of this health plan; the policies and procedures 
that support this health plan; the health care provide r’s input; and your understa nding of coverage by this 
health plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may use an individual consideration approach when Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  judges it to be appropriate. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will follow its 
standard guidelines when it resolves your problem or concern. 
If after speaking with a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service representative, you still 
disagree with a decision that is given to you, you may request a formal review through the Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  Member Appeal and Grievance Program. You may also request a formal review if Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has not responded to you within three wo rking days of receiving your inquiry. 
If this does happen, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will notify you and let you know the steps you may 
follow to request a formal review. 
Appeal and Grievance Review Process 
Internal Formal Review 
How to Request an Internal Formal Appeal or Grievance Review To request an internal formal appeal  or grievance  review, you (or your authorized or legal representative) 
have three options: 
 To write or send a fax.  The preferred option is for you to send your request for an appeal  or a 
grievance  review in writing to: Member Appeal and Grievance Program, Blue Cross Blue Shield Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 86 of Massachusetts, One Enterprise Drive, Quincy, MA 02171-2126 . Or, you may fax your request 
to 1-617-246-3616. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know that your request was 
received by sending you a written confirmation within  15 calendar days. When you send your request, 
you should be sure to include any docu mentation that will help the review. 
 To send an e-mail.  You may send your request for an appeal  or a grievance  review to the Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  Member Appeal and Grievance Program e-mail address 
grievances@bcbsma.com . Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know that your request 
was received by sending you a confirmation immedi ately by e-mail. When you send your request, you 
should be sure to include any docume ntation that will help the review. 
 To make a telephone call. You may call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  Member Appeal and 
Grievance Program at 1-800-472-2689 . When your request is made by phone, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  will send you a written account of your request for an appeal  or a grievance  review within 
48 hours of your phone call. 
Before you make an appeal  or file a grievance , you should read “What to Include in an Appeal or Grievance 
Review Request” that shows later in this section. 
Once your appeal  or grievance  request is received, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will research the 
case in detail. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for more information if it is needed and let you 
know in writing of the review decision or the outcome of the review. If your request for a review is about 
termination of your coverage for concurrent services that were previously approved by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue , the disputed coverage will continue until this review process is completed. This 
continuation of your coverage does not apply to services: that are limited by a day, dollar, or visit benefit 
limit and that exceed the benefit limit ; that are non- covered services ; or that were received prior to the time 
you requested the formal review. It also does not apply if your request for a review was not received on a timely basis, based on the course of the treatment. 
All requests for an appeal  or a grievance  review must be received by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
within 180 calendar days of the date of treatment, ev ent, or circumstance which is the cause of your dispute 
or complaint, such as the date you were told of the service denial or claim denial. 
Office of Patient Protection 
The Massachusetts Office of Patient Protection can help members  with information and reports about health 
plan appeals and complaints. To contact that office, you can call 1-800-436-7757 . Or, you can fax a request 
to 1-617-624-5046 . Or, you can go online and log on to the Office of Patient Protection’s Web site at 
www.mass.gov/hpc/opp
. 
What to Include in an Appeal or Grievance Review Request 
Your request for an internal formal appeal  or grievance  review should include: the name, ID number, and 
daytime phone number of the member  asking for the review; a description of the problem; all relevant dates; 
names of health care providers or ad ministrative staff involved; and deta ils of the attempt that has been 
made to resolve the problem. 
 Appealing a Coverage Decision.  A “coverage decision” is a decision that Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  makes about your covera ge or about the amount Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
pay for your health care services or drugs. Fo r example, your doctor may have to contact Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  and ask for a coverage decision before you receive proposed services. Or, a 
coverage decision is made when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  decides what is covered and how Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 87 much you will pay for services you have already received. In some cases, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  might decide a service or drug is not cove red or is no longer covered for you. You can 
make an appeal  if you disagree with a coverage decision made by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
When you make an appeal  about a medical necessity  coverage decision, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue will review your health plan contract and the pol icies and procedures that are in effect for your 
appeal  along with medical treatment information that will help in the review. Some examples of the 
medical information that will help Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  review your appeal  may 
include: medical records related to your appeal , provider consultation and office notes, and related 
lab or other test results. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  needs to review your medical records 
and you have not provided your consent, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will promptly send you 
an authorization form to sign. You must return this signed form to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
It will allow for the release of your medical records. You have the right to look at and get copies (free 
of charge) of records and criteria that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has and that are relevant to 
your appeal , including the identity of any experts who were consulted. 
If you disagree with how your claim was paid or yo u are denied coverage for a specific health care 
service or drug, you can make an appeal  about the coverage decision. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue will review the health plan contract that is in effect for your appeal  to see if all of the rules were 
properly followed and to see if the service or drug is specifically excluded or limited by your health 
plan. The appeal  decision will be based on the terms of your health plan contract. For example, if a 
service is excluded or limited by your health plan contract, no benefits can be provided even if the 
services are medically necessary  for you. For this reason, you should be sure to review all parts of 
your health plan contract for any coverage limits and exclusions. These parts include your Subscriber 
Certificate and Schedule of Benefits  and riders  (if there are any) that apply for your health plan 
contract. 
 Filing a Grievance.  You can file a grievance  when you have a complaint about the care or service 
you received from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or from a health care provider who participates 
in your health care network. Some examples of these types of problems are: you are unhappy with the 
quality of the care you have received; you are having trouble getting an appointment or waiting too long to get care; or you are unhappy with how the customer service representative has treated you. If 
you submit a formal grievance  about the quality of care you received from a Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will contact you to obtain your permission to 
contact the provider (if your permission is not included in your formal grievance ). For this type of 
grievance , Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will investigate the grievance  with your permission, but 
the results of any provider peer review are conf idential. For this reason, you will not receive the 
results of this type of investigation. 
Choosing an Authorized Representative 
You may choose to have another pe rson act on your behalf during the appeal  or grievance  review process. 
Except as described below, you must designate this person in writing to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
If your claim is for urgent care  or emergency medical care services, a health care professional who has 
knowledge about your medical condition may act as your authorized representative. In this case, you do not 
have to designate the health care pr ofessional in writing. If you are not ab le to designate another person to 
act on your behalf, then a conservator, a person with power of attorney, or a family member may act as 
your authorized representative. Or, they may appoint so meone else to act as your authorized representative. Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 88 Who Handles the Appeal or Grievance Review 
All appeals  and grievances  are reviewed by professionals who are knowledgeable about Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  and the issues involved in the appeal  or grievance . The professionals who will review 
your appeal  or grievance  will be different from those who participated in Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue’s  prior decision regarding the subject of your appeal  or grievance , nor will they work for anyone who 
did. When a review is related to a medical necessity  denial, at least one reviewer will be an individual who 
is an actively practicing health care professional in the same or similar specialty who usually treats the 
medical condition or performs the procedure or provid es treatment that is the subject of your review. 
Response Time for an Appeal or Grievance Review 
The review and response for an internal formal appeal  or grievance  review will be completed within 
30 calendar days. Every reasonable effo rt will be made to speed up the review for requests that involve 
health care services that are soon to be obtained by the member . 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may extend the 30-calendar-day time fr ame to complete a review when 
both Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  and the member  agree that additional time is required to fully 
investigate and respond to the request. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may also extend the 
30-calendar-day time frame when the revi ew requires your medical records and Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  needs your authorization to get these records.  The 30-day response time will not include the 
days from when Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  sends you the authorization form to sign until it receives 
your signed authorization form. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  does not receive your authorization 
within 30 working days after your request for a review is received, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may 
make a final decision about your request without th at medical information. In any case, for a review 
involving services that have not yet been obtained by you, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will ask for 
your permission to extend the 30-day time frame if it  cannot complete the review within 30 calendar days 
of receipt of your request for a review. 
An appeal  or grievance  that is not acted upon within the time frames  specified by applicable federal or state 
law will be considered resolved in favor of the member . 
Important Note: If your appeal  or grievance  review began after an inquiry, the 30-day response time will 
begin on the day you tell Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  that you disagree with Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue’s  answer and would like an internal formal review. 
Written Response for an Appeal or Grievance Review 
Once the review is completed, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will let you know in writing of the 
decision or the outcome of the review. If Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  continues to deny coverage for 
all or part of a health care service or supply, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send an explanation to 
you. This notice will include: informa tion related to the details of your appeal  or grievance ; the reasons 
that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has denied the request and the app licable terms of your coverage in 
this health plan; the specific medi cal and scientific reasons for which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
has denied the request; any alternative treatment or he alth care services and supplies that would be covered; 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  clinical guidelines that apply and were used and any review criteria; and 
how to request an external review. 
Appeal and Grievance Review Records 
You have the right to look at and get copies of records and criteria that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
has and that are relevant to your appeal  or grievance . These copies will be free of charge.  Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will maintain a record of all formal appeals  and grievances , including the response for 
each review, for up to seven years. Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 89 Expedited Review for Immediate or Urgently-Needed Services 
In place of the internal formal review as described a bove in this section, you have the right to request an 
“expedited” review right away when your situa tion is for immediate or urgently-needed services. Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will respond to formal requests for a re view for immediate or urgently-needed 
services as follows: 
 When your request for a review concerns medical care or treatment for which waiting for a response 
under the review time frames described above would ser iously jeopardize your life or health or your 
ability to regain maximum function as determined by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  or your 
physician, or if your physician says that you will have  severe pain that cannot be adequately managed 
without the care or treatment that is the subject of the review, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
review your request and notify you of the decision w ithin 72 hours after your request is received, or 
such shorter time period as  required by federal law. 
 When a formal review is requested while you are an inpatient , Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
complete the review and make a decision regard ing the request before you are discharged from that 
inpatient  stay. 
 Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  decision  to deny payment for health care services, including 
durable medical equipment, may be reversed within  48 hours if your attending physician certifies to 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  that a denial for those health care services would create a 
substantial risk of serious harm to you if you we re to wait for the outcome of the normal formal 
review process. Your physician can also request the reversal of a denial for durable medical 
equipment earlier than 48 hours by providing more specific information to Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  about the immediate and severe harm to you. 
 A formal review requested by a member  with a terminal illness will be completed by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  within five working days of receiving th e request. In this case, if the expedited 
review results in a denial for health care services or treatment, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will 
send a letter to the member  within five working days. This lette r will include: information related to 
the details of the request for a review; the reasons that Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has denied 
the request and the applicable terms of your covera ge in this health plan; the specific medical and 
scientific reasons for which Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has denied the request; any alternative 
treatment or health care services and supplies that would be covered; Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue clinical guidelines that apply and were used and any review criteria; and how to request a 
hearing. When the member  requests a hearing, the hearing will be held within ten days. (Or, it will be 
held within five working days if the attending  physician determines after consultation with Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s Medical Director and based on standard medical practice that the 
effectiveness of the health care service, supply, or  treatment would be materially reduced if it were 
not furnished at the earliest possible date.) You a nd/or your authorized or legal representative(s) may 
attend this hearing. 
External Review 
You must first go through the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internal formal appeal  and grievance  
review process as described above, unless Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has failed to comply with the 
time frames for the internal formal review or if y ou (or your authorized or legal representative) are 
requesting an expedited external review at the same time you (or your authorized or legal representative) 
are requesting an expedited internal review. The Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  internal formal review 
decision may be to continue to deny all or part of you r coverage in this health plan. When you are denied 
coverage for a service or supply because Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has determined that the service 
or supply is not medically necessary , you have the right to an external review. You are not required to 
pursue an external review. Your decision whether to pursue an external review will not affect your other 
coverage. If you receive a denial letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  in response to your internal 
formal review, the letter will tell you what steps you can take to file a request for an external review. The Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 90 external review will be conducted by a review agency  under contract with the Massachusetts Office of 
Patient Protection. 
How to Request an External Review 
To obtain an external review, you must submit your re quest on the form required by the Office of Patient 
Protection. On this form, you (or your authorized or legal representative) must sign a consent to release 
your medical information for external review. Attached to the form, you must send a copy of the letter of 
denial that you received from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . In addition, you must send the fee required 
to pay for your portion of the cost of the review. The form, as well as the denial letter from Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue , will tell you about your fee. Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will be charged the rest 
of the cost by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. (Your portion of the cost may be waived by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the case of extreme financial hardship.) If you decide to request an 
external review, you must file you r request within the four months after you receive the denial letter 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . 
You (or your authorized or legal representative) also have the right to request an “expedited” external 
review. When requesting an expedited external review, you must include a written statement from a 
physician. This statement should explain that a delay in providing or continuing those health care services 
that have been denied for coverage would pose a serio us and immediate threat to your health. Based on this 
information, the Office of Patient Protection will dete rmine if you are eligible for an expedited external 
review. You (or your authorized or legal representative) al so have the right to request an expedited external 
review at the same time that you file a request  for an expedited internal formal review. 
If your request for a review is regarding terminati on of coverage for concurrent services that were 
previously approved by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue , you may request approval to have the disputed 
coverage continue until the external review process is  completed. To do this, you must make your request 
before the end of the second working day af ter your receipt of the denial letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue. The request may be approved if  it is determined that not continuing these services may pose 
substantial harm to your health. In the event that coverage is approved to continue, you will not be charged 
for those health care services, regard less of the outcome of your review. This continuation of coverage does 
not apply to services: that are limited by a day, dollar, or visit benefit limit  and that exceed the benefit limit ; 
that are non -covered services ; or that were received prior to the time you requested the external review. 
To contact the Office of Patient Protection, you can call toll free at 1-800-436-7757 . Or, you can fax a 
request to 1-617-624-5046 . Or, you can go online and log on to the Office of Patient Protection’s Web site 
at www.mass.gov/hpc/opp . 
External Review Process 
The Office of Patient Protection will screen all requ ests for an external review. They will begin this 
screening within 48 hours of receiving a request for an expedited external review and within five business 
days for all other external review requests. The Offi ce of Patient Protection will determine if your request 
for an external review: has been submitted as requi red by state regulation and described above; does not 
involve a service or benefit that is excluded by your health plan as explicitly st ated in your health plan 
contract; and results from an adverse determination, except that no adverse determination is necessary when 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  has failed to comply with the timelines for an internal appeal  or 
grievance  review or if you (or your authorized or legal representative) are requesti ng an expedited external 
review at the same time you are requesting an expedited internal formal review. 
When your request is eligible for an external review, an external review agency  will be selected and your 
case will be referred to them. You (or your authorized or legal representative) will be notified of the name 
of the review agency. This notice w ill also state whether or not your case is being reviewed on an expedited Part 10 – Appeal and Grievance Program  (continued)

 Page 91 basis. This notice will also be sent to Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  along with a copy of your signed 
medical information release form. 
External Review Decisions and Notice 
The review agency will consider all aspects of the case and send a written response of the outcome. They 
will send the response to you (or your author ized or legal representative) and to Blue Cross Blue Shield 
HMO Blue  within 45 calendar days of receiving the referra l from the Office of Patient Protection. In the 
case of an expedited review, you will be notified of their decision within 72 hours. This 72-hour period 
starts when the review agency receives y our case from the Office of Patient Protection. 
If the review agency overturns Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue’s  decision in whole or in part, Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  will send you (or your authorized or le gal representative) a notice within five 
working days of receiving the review decision made  by the agency. This notice will confirm the decision

HMO Blue  who will make sure your appeal  or grievance  is resolved.

 Page 92 Part 11  
Group Policy 
This part applies to you when yo u enroll in this health plan as a group member.  Under a group  contract , 
the subscriber’s  group  has an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide its group 
members  with access to health care services and benefits. The group  will make payments to Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue  for its group  members  for coverage in this health plan. The group  should also deliver 
to its group  members  all notices from Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The group  is the subscriber’s  
agent and is not the agent of Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . For questions about enrollment and billing, 
you must contact the group  (which may also be referred to as your plan sponsor ). The plan sponsor  is 
usually the subscriber’s  employer and is the same as the plan sponsor designated under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). If you are not sure who your plan sponsor  
is, contact your employer. 
Important Note: If you enrolled in this health plan through  the Massachusetts Health Connector, your 
group  has a contract with the Health Connector and not Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The group  
makes payments to the Health Connector for your covera ge in this health plan. The Health Connector will 
send all notices to the subscriber . You must call the Health Connector  directly for any questions about: 
your enrollment in this health plan; your premium  payments; and any member ship changes you need to 
make such as a change to your name or address. For a ny questions about your hea lth plan coverage or your 
claims, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. 
Eligibility and Enrollment for Group Coverage 
Eligible Employee 
An employee is eligible to en roll in this health plan as a subscriber  under this group contract  as long as the 
employee meets the rules on length of service, activ e employment, and number of hours worked that the 
plan sponsor  has set to determine eligibility for group  coverage. For details, contact your plan sponsor . 
Eligible Spouse 
The subscriber  may enroll an eligible spouse for covera ge in this health plan under their group  contract . 
An “eligible spouse” includes the subscriber’s  legal spouse. (A legal civil union spouse, where applicable, 
is eligible to enroll for coverage  in this health plan under the  group  contract  to the extent that a legal civil 
union spouse is determined eligible by the plan sponsor . For more details, contact your plan sponsor .) 
Former Spouse 
In the event of a divorce or a legal separa tion, the person who was the spouse of the subscriber  prior to the 
divorce or legal separation will remain eligible for coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  group  
contract , whether or not the judgment was entered prior to the effective date  of the group  contract . This 
health plan coverage is provided with no additional premium  other than the normal cost of covering a 
current spouse. The former spouse will re main eligible for this coverage only  until the subscriber  is no 
longer required by the judgment to provide hea lth insurance for the former spouse or the subscriber  or 
former spouse remarries, whichever comes first. In these situations, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
must be notified within 30 da ys of a change to the former spouse’s address. Otherwise, Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue  will not be liable for any acts or omissions due to having the former spouse’s incorrect 
address on file. Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 93 If the subscriber  remarries, the former spouse may continue cove rage in this health plan under a separate 
membership within the subscriber’s  group , provided the divorce judgment requires that the subscriber  
provide health insurance for the former  spouse. This is true even if the subscriber’s  new spouse is not 
enrolled for coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  group  contract . 
Eligible Dependents 
The subscriber  may enroll eligible dependents for coverage in this health plan under their group  contract . 
“Eligible dependents” include the subscriber’s  (or subscriber’s  spouse’s) children until the end of the 
calendar month in which the child turn s age 26. To be an eligible dependent, the child is not required to 
live with the subscriber  or the subscriber’s  spouse, be a dependent on the subscriber’s  or spouse’s tax 
return, or be a full-time student. Th ese eligible dependents may include: 
 A newborn child. The effective date  of coverage for a newborn child will be the child’s date of birth 
provided that the subscriber  formally notifies the plan sponsor within 30 days of the date of birth. 
(A claim for a member’s  maternity admission may be considered by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue to be this notice when the subscriber’s  coverage is a family plan.) This health plan provides 
coverage for newborn infants for injury and sic kness. This includes the necessary care and treatment 
of medically diagnosed congenital defects, birth ab normalities, and premature birth. The coverage for 
these services is subject to all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 An adopted child. The effective date  of coverage for an adopted child  will be the date of placement of 
the child with the subscriber  for the purpose of adoption. The effective date  of coverage for an 
adoptive child who has been living with the subscriber  and for whom the subscriber  has been getting 
foster care payments will be the date the petition to adopt is filed. If the subscriber  is enrolled under a 
family plan as of the date they assume custody of a child for the purpose of  adoption, the child’s 
health care services for injury or sickness will be c overed from the date of custody. (This coverage is 
provided without a waiting period or pre-existing condition restriction.) This includes the necessary 
care and treatment of medically diagnosed congen ital defects, birth abnormalities, and premature 
birth. The coverage for these services is subject to  all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 A newborn infant of an enrolled dependent child immediately from the moment of birth and 
continuing after, until the enrolled dependent child is no longer eligible as a dependent. 
If an eligible dependent child is married, the dependent child can enroll for coverage under the subscriber’s 
group contract . And, as long as that enrolled child is an eligib le dependent, their children are also eligible 
for coverage under the subscriber’s group contract . The dependent child’s spouse is not eligible to enroll 
as a dependent for coverage under the subscriber’s group contract . 
An eligible dependent may also include: 
 A person under age 26 who is not the subscriber’s  (or subscriber’s  spouse’s) child but who qualifies 
as a dependent of the subscriber  under the Internal Revenue Code. When the dependent loses their 
dependent status under the Internal  Revenue Code, that dependent w ill continue to be eligible as a 
dependent for coverage in th is health plan under the subscriber’s  group contract  for two years after 
the end of the calendar year in which they last  qualified as a dependent under the Internal Revenue 
Code or until the dependent turn s age 26, whichever comes first. 
 A child recognized under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order as having the right to enroll for 
health care coverage. 
 A disabled dependent child  age 26 or older. A dependent child who is mentally or physically 
incapable of earning their own living and who is enrolled under the subscriber’s group contract  will 
continue to be covered after they would otherwise lose dependent eligibility under the subscriber’s  
group contract , so long as the child continues to be mentally  or physically incapable of earning their 
own living. In this case, the subscriber  must make arrangements with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue through the plan sponsor  not more than 30 days after the date the child would normally lose Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 94 eligibility. Also, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  must be given any medical or other information 
that it may need to determine if the child can ma intain coverage in this health plan under the 
subscriber’s  group  contract . From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  may conduct 
reviews that will require a statement from the attending physician. This is to confirm that the child is 
still an eligible disabled dependent child. 
Important Reminder: The eligibility provisions for dependents that  are described in this section may differ 
from the federal tax laws that de fine who may qualify as a dependent. 
Enrollment Periods for Group Coverage 
Initial Enrollment 
You may enroll for coverage in this health plan under a group  contract  on your initial group  eligibility date. 
This date is determined by your plan sponsor . The plan sponsor  is responsible for providing you with 
details about how and when you may enroll fo r coverage in this health plan under a group  contract . To 
enroll, you must complete the enrollment form provided by your plan sponsor  no later than 30 days after 
your eligibility date. (For more information, contact your plan sponsor .) If you choose not to enroll for 
coverage in this health plan under a group  contract  on your initial eligibility date, you may enroll under a 
group contract  only during your group’s  open enrollment period or within  30 days of a special enrollment 
event as provided by federal or Massachusetts law. 
Special Enrollment 
If an eligible employee or an eligible dependent (i ncluding the employee’s spou se) chooses not to enroll 
for coverage in this health plan under a group  contract  on their initial group eligibility date, federal or 
Massachusetts law may allow the eligible employee and/ or their eligible dependents to enroll under the 
group  contract  when: 
 The employee and/or their eligible dependents have  a loss of other coverage (see “Loss of Other 
Qualified Coverage” below for more information); or 
 The employee gains a new eligible dependent (see “New Dependents” below for more information); 
or 
 The employee and/or their eligible dependent become eligible for assistance under a Medicaid plan or 
a state Children’s Health Insurance Program plan. 
These rights are known as your “special enrollment right s.” There may be additional special enrollment 
rights as a result of changes required by federal law.  For example, these changes may include special 
enrollment rights for: individuals who are newly eligib le for coverage as a result of changes to dependent 
eligibility; and/or individuals who are newly eligible fo r coverage as a result of the elimination of a lifetime 
maximum. 
Loss of Other Qualified Coverage 
An eligible employee may choose not to enroll themself or an eligible dependent (including a spouse) for 
coverage in this health plan under a group  contract  on the initial group  eligibility date because they or the 
eligible dependent has other health  plan coverage as defined by federa l law. (This is referred to as 
“qualified” coverage.) In this case, the employ ee and the eligible dependent may enroll under the group  
contract  if the employee or the eligible dependent at a later date loses that other qualified health plan 
coverage due to any one of the following reasons. 
 The employee or the eligible dependents (including  a spouse) cease to be eligible for the other 
qualified health plan. For example, this could mean th at the loss of the other qualified health plan was 
due to: the loss of the spouse’s coverage; the death of  the spouse; divorce; loss of dependent status; or 
involuntary termination. This includes when an em ployee or eligible dependent is covered under a Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 95 Medicaid plan or a state Children’s Health Insuran ce Program plan and coverage is terminated as a 
result of loss of eligibility for that coverage. 
 The employer that is sponsoring the other qualifie d group health plan coverage ceases to make 
employer contributions for the othe r group health plan coverage. 
 The employee or the eligible dependents (includi ng a spouse) exhaust their continuation of group 
coverage under the other qualified group health plan. 
 The prior qualified health plan was terminated due  to the insolvency of the health plan carrier. 
Important Note: You will not have this special enrollment right if the loss of other health plan coverage 
is a result of the eligible employee or the subscriber  or the eligible dependent’s failure to pay the applicable 
premiums. 
New Dependents 
If an eligible employee gains a new spouse or other ne w eligible dependent(s) due to marriage, adoption, 
placement for adoption, or birth, the employee and th e spouse and/or the new dependent(s) may enroll for 
coverage in this health plan under a group  contract . (If the new dependent is gained by birth, adoption, or 
placement for adoption, enrollment under the group  contract will be retroactive to the date of birth or the 
date of adoption or the date of placement for adop tion, provided that the enrollment time requirements 
described below are met.) 
Special Enrollment Time Requirement 
To exercise your special enrollment rights, you must notify your plan sponsor  no later than 30 days after 
the date when any one of the following situations occu r: the date on which the loss of your other coverage 
occurs or the date on which the subscriber  gains a new dependent; or the date on which the subscriber  
receives notice that a dependent child who was not previ ously eligible is newly eligible for coverage as a 
result of changes to dependent eligibility; or the date on which you receive notice that you are newly eligible 
for coverage as a result of the elimination of a lifet ime maximum. For example, if your coverage under 
another health plan is terminated, you must request enrollment for coverage in this health plan under a 
group  contract  within 30 days after your other health  care coverage ends. Upon request, the plan sponsor  
will send you any special forms you may need. If you do not request enrollment within 30 days, you will 
have to wait until the group’s  next open enrollment period to enroll under a group contract . You also have 
special enrollment rights related to termination of coverage under a state Children’s Health Insurance 
Program plan or a Medicaid plan or eligibility for assistance under a Medicaid plan or a state Children’s 
Health Insurance Program plan. When this  situation applies, you must notify your plan sponsor  to request 
coverage no later than 60 days afte r the coverage terminates or the em ployee or eligible dependent is 
determined to be eligible for assistance. 
Qualified Medical Child Support Order 
If the subscriber  chooses not to enroll an eligible dependent for coverage in this health plan under a group  
contract  on the initial group  eligibility date, the subscriber  may be required by law to enroll the dependent 
if the subscriber  is subject to a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO). This QMCSO order is 
a state court or administrative agency order that requires an employer’s group  to provide coverage to the 
child of an employee who is covered, or eligible to enroll for group  coverage, in this health plan. 
Open Enrollment Period 
If you choose not to enroll for coverage in this health plan under a group  contract  within 30 days of your 
initial group  eligibility date, you may enroll during your group’s  open enrollment period. The open 
enrollment period is the time each year during which eligible persons may enroll for or change coverage 
for the next year. The open enrollment period is announced by the group  to all eligible employees. To enroll 
for coverage in this health plan under a group  contract  during this enrollment period, you must complete Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued)

date specified in the group’s  enrollment packet. 
Other Membership Changes 
Generally, the subscriber  may make membership chang es (for example, change from a subscriber  only 
plan to a family plan) only if the subscriber  has a change in family status. This includes a change such as: 
marriage or divorce; birth, adoption, or change in custody of a child; death of an enrolled spouse or dependent; or the loss of an enro lled dependent’s eligibility under the subscriber’s group contract . If you 
want to ask for a membership change or you n eed to change your name or mailing address, you 
should call or write to your plan sponsor . The plan sponsor  will send you any special forms that you may 
need. You must request the change w ithin the time period required by the subscriber’s group  to make a 
change. If you do not make the change within the required time period, you will have to wait until the 
group’s  next open enrollment period to make the change. All changes are allowed only when they comply 
with the eligibility and en rollment rules set by the plan sponsor  for your group  coverage. They must also 
comply with the conditions outlined in the group  contract  and in the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  
Manual of Underwriting Guidelines for Group Business. (If you enrolled in this health plan through the 
Massachusetts Health Connector, chang es must comply with the Health C onnector’s policies. If this applies 
to you, you must call the Health Connector directly for any questions about any membership changes you 
need to make such as a change to your name or address.)

Continuation of Group Coverage 
Family and Medical Leave Act 
An employee may continue coverage  in this health plan under a group  contract  as provided by the Family 
and Medical Leave Act. The Family and Medical Leave Act will generally apply to you if your group  has 
50 or more employees. For more information, contact your plan sponsor . If the employee chooses to 
continue group  coverage during a qualifying leave, the employ ee will be given the same health care benefits 
that would have been provided if th e employee were working, with the same premium  contribution ratio. If 
the employee’s premium  for continued coverage under the group  contract  is more than 30 days late, the 
plan sponsor  will send written notice to the employee. It will tell the employee that their coverage will be 
terminated. It will also give the date of the terminati on if payment is not received by that date. This notice 
will be mailed at least 15 days before the termination date. 
If coverage in this health plan under the group  contract  is discontinued due to non-payment of premium , 
the employee’s coverage will be restored when they re turn to work to the same level of benefits as those 
the employee would have had if the leave had not been taken and the premium  payment(s) had not been 
missed. This includes coverage for eligible depende nts. The employee will not be required to meet any 
qualification requirements imposed by Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  when they return to work. This 
includes: new or additional waiting periods; waiting for an open enrollm ent period; or passing a medical 
exam to reinstate coverage. You should contact your plan sponsor  with any questions that you may have 
about your coverage during a leave of absence. 
Limited Extension of Group Coverage under State Law 
If you lose eligibility for coverage in this health plan under a group contract  due to a plant closing or a 
partial plant closing (as defined by law) in M assachusetts, you may conti nue coverage under the group 
contract  as provided by state law. If this happens to you, you and your group  will each pay your shares of 
the premium  cost for up to 90 days after the plant closing. Then, to continue your group  coverage for up to 
39 more weeks, you will pay 100% of the premium  cost. At this same time, you may also be eligible for 
continued group  coverage under other state laws or under fede ral law (see below). If you are, the starting 
date for continued group  coverage under all of these laws will be  the same date. But, after the 90-day 
extension period provided by this state law ends, you may have to pay more premium  to continue your 
coverage under the group  contract . If you become eligible for cove rage under another employer sponsored 
health plan at any time before the 39-week extension period ends, continued covera ge in this health plan 
under the group  contract  under these provisions also ends. 
Continuation of Group Coverage under Federal or State Law 
When you are no longer eligible for cove rage in this health plan under a group  contract , you may be eligible 
to continue group  coverage as provided by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 
(COBRA) or under Massachusetts state law. (These provisions apply to you if your group  has two or more 
employees.) To continue this group  coverage, you may be require d to pay up to 102% of the premium  cost. 
These laws apply to you if you lose eligibility for coverage due to one of the following reasons.

employee or former spouse remarries, whichever co mes first. The former spouse’s eligibility for 
continued group  coverage will start on the date of divorce, even if they continue coverage under the 
employee’s group  contract . While the former spouse continues coverage under the employee’s group  
contract , there is no additional premium . After remarriage, under state and federal law, the former 
spouse may be eligible to continue group  coverage in this health plan under a separate group  contract  
for additional premium .) 
 Death of the subscriber . 
 Subscriber’s  entitlement to Medicare benefits. 
 Loss of status as an eligible dependent. 
The period of this continued group  coverage begins with the date of  your qualifying event. And, the length 
of this continued group  coverage will be up to 36 months from that  qualifying event. This is true except for 
termination of employment or reduction of  work hours, in which cases continued group  coverage is 
available for only 18 months or, if you are qualified for disability under Title II or Title XVI of the Social 
Security Act, up to 29 months. (See below for more  information about continued coverage for disabled 
employees.) You should contact your plan sponsor  for more help about continued coverage. 
Important Note: When a subscriber’s  legal same-sex spouse is no longe r eligible for coverage under the 
group  contract , that spouse (or if it applies, that civil union spouse) and their dependents may continue 
coverage in the subscriber’s  group  to the same extent that a legal op posite-sex spouse (and their dependents) 
could continue coverage upon loss of  eligibility for coverage under the group  contract . 
Additional Continued Coverage for Disabled Employees 
At the time of the employee’s terminat ion of employment or reduction in hours (or within 60 days of the 
qualifying event under federal law), if an employee or thei r eligible dependent is de termined to be disabled 
under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act, continued group  coverage will be available for up to 
29 months from the date of the qualifying event. The premium  cost for the additional 11 months may be up 
to 150% of the premium  rate. If during these 11 months eligibility for disability is lost, group  coverage may 
cancel before the 29 months is comp leted. You should contact your plan sponsor  for more help about 
continued coverage. 
Special Rules for Retired Employees 
A retired employee, the spouse, and/or eligible depe ndent children of a retired  employee or a surviving 
spouse of a retired deceased employ ee who loses eligibility for coverage in this health plan under the group  
contract  as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding (Title 11 of  the United States Code) is also eligible to 
continue group  coverage as provided by COBRA or under M assachusetts state law. A retired employee 
and/or the surviving spouse of  a deceased retired employee may enroll for lifetime continued group  
coverage as of the date of the bankruptc y proceeding, provided that the loss of group  eligibility occurs 
within one year before the date on which the bankruptcy proceeding begins. Or, if group  eligibility is lost 
within one year after the date on which the bankrup tcy proceeding begins, they may enroll for lifetime 
continued group  coverage as of the date group  eligibility is lost. Spouses and/or eligible dependents of 
these retired employees may enroll for continued group  coverage until the retired employee dies. Once the 
retired employee dies, their surviving spouse and/or e ligible dependents may enroll for up to an additional 
36 months of continued group  coverage beyond the date of the retired employee’s death. 
Lifetime continued coverage in  this health plan for retired employees will end if the group  cancels its 
agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide its group members  with coverage in this 
health plan under a group contract  or for any of the other reasons described below. (See “Termination of

Medicare Program 
When you are eligible for Medicare and Medicare is allowed by federal law to be the primary payor, the 
coverage provided by this health plan will be reduced  by the amount of benef its allowed under Medicare 
for the same covered services . This reduction will be made whether or  not you actually receive the benefits 
from Medicare. 
Under Age 65 with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
If you are under age 65 and are eligible for Medicare only because of ESRD (permanent kidney failure), 
the benefits of this health plan will be provided be fore Medicare benefits. This is the case only during the 
first 30 months of your ESRD Medica re coverage. After 30 months, the be nefits that are provided by this 
health plan will be reduced by the amou nt that Medicare allows for the same covered services . 
Under Age 65 with Other Disability 
If your group  employs 100 or more employees and if you are under age 65 and you are eligible for Medicare 
only because of a disability other than ESRD, this h ealth plan will provide benefits before Medicare 
benefits. This is the case only if you are the actively employed subscriber  or the enrolled spouse or 
dependent of the actively employed subscriber . If you are an inactive employee or a retiree or the enrolled 
spouse or dependent of the inactive employee or retiree, the benefits that are provided by this health plan 
will be reduced by the amount that Medicare allows for the same covered services . (In some cases, this 
provision also applies to certain smaller groups. Your plan sponsor  can tell you if it applies to your group .) 
Age 65 or Older 
If your group  employs 20 or more employees and if you are ag e 65 or older and are eligible for Medicare 
only because of age, this health plan will provide benefits before Medicare benefits as long as you have 
chosen this health plan as your primary payor. This can be the case only if you are an actively employed 
subscriber  or the enrolled spouse of the actively employed subscriber . (If you are actively employed at the Part 11 – Group Policy  (continued)

Dual Medicare Eligibility 
If you are eligible for Medicare because of ESRD and a disability or because of ESRD and you are age 
65 or older, this health plan will provide benefits befo re Medicare benefits. This is the case during the first 
30 months of your ESRD Medicare coverage only if the coverage under this health plan was primary when 
you became eligible for ESRD Medicare benefits. Th en, for as long as you maintain dual Medicare 
eligibility, the benefits that are provided by this hea lth plan will be reduced by the amount that Medicare 
allows for the same covered services . (This provision may not apply to you. To find out if it does, contact 
your plan sponsor .)

 Page 102 Part 12  
Individual Policy 
This part applies to you when you enroll in this health plan as a direct pay member (and not as a group 
member  under a group contract ). Under an individual  contract , the subscriber  has an agreement with Blue 
Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  to provide the subscriber  and their enrolled eligible spouse and other enrolled 
eligible dependents with access to health care services and benefits. The subscriber  will make payments to 
Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  for coverage in this health plan under an individual contract . For 
questions about enrollment and billing, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service 
office. 
Important Note: If you enrolled in this health plan through  the Massachusetts Health Connector, the 
subscriber  has an agreement with th e Health Connector and not Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . The 
subscriber  will usually make payments to the Health Connector  for coverage in this health plan. The Health 
Connector will send all notices to the subscriber . You must call the Health Connector directly for any 
questions about: your enrollment in this health plan; your premium  payments; and any membership changes 
you need to make such as a change to your name or  address. For any questions about your health plan 
coverage or your claims, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service office. 
Eligibility and Enrollment for Individual Coverage 
Eligible Individual 
You are eligible for coverage in this health plan under an individual  contract  as long as you are a resident 
of Massachusetts. A “resident” is a person who lives in Massachusetts as shown by evidence that is considered acceptable by  Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue . This means Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO 
Blue may ask you for evidence such as a lease or rental agr eement, a mortgage bill, or a utility bill. The fact 
that you are in a nursing home, a hospital, or other institution does not by itself mean you are a resident. And, you are not a resident if you come to Massachuse tts to receive medical care or to attend school but 
you still have residency ou tside of Massachusetts. 
If you are under age 18 and you are requesting to enroll as a subscriber , the enrollment form must be 
completed by your parent or guardian. In this case, the person who is executing the contract (your parent 
or guardian) is not eligible for benef its under your coverage in this health  plan. But, they will be responsible 
for acting on behalf of the subscriber  as necessary and for paying the monthly premium  for your coverage. 
The person who executes the contract will be considered your authorized representative. 
This health plan is not a Medicare supplement plan.  If you are eligible for Medicare, this health plan 
cannot be issued to you. You should look at the Guid e to Health Insurance for People with Medicare. You 
may be able to sign up for a health plan that is d esigned to supplement Medicare. To ask for a copy of the 
Guide, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office. (See Part 1.) If you are 
already enrolled in this health plan when you beco me eligible for Medicare, you may choose to stay 
enrolled. If you choose to remain enrolled, Medicare may provide coverage for the same health care services 
that are covered by this health plan. In this case, Medicare is the primary payor. 
Eligible Spouse 
The subscriber  may enroll an eligible spouse for covera ge in this health plan under their individual  contract . 
An “eligible spouse” includes the subscriber’s  legal spouse or legal civil uni on spouse. An eligible spouse Part 12 – Individual Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 103 must also meet all of the same eligibility conditions as described above for an eligible individual. (If the 
spouse is eligible for Medicare, this  health plan cannot be issued to the spouse. You should use the Guide 
to Health Insurance for People with Medicare to find a health plan that is designed to supplement Medicare. 
To ask for a copy of the Guide, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  customer service office.) 
Former Spouse 
In the event of a divorce or a legal separa tion, the person who was the spouse of the subscriber  prior to the 
divorce or legal separation may maintain c overage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  individual  
contract . This coverage may continue only until: the subscriber  is no longer required by the divorce 
judgment to provide health insurance for the former spouse; or the subscriber  or former spouse remarries. 
In either case, the former spouse may wish to enroll as a subscriber  under their own individual  contract . 
The Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue customer service office can help  you with these options. In these 
situations, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  must be notified within 30 days of a change to the former 
spouse’s address. Otherwise, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue  will not be liable for any acts or omissions 
due to having the former spou se’s incorrect address on file. 
Eligible Dependents 
The subscriber  may enroll eligible dependents for cove rage in this health plan under their individual 
contract . Eligible dependents must meet all of the sa me eligibility conditions as described above for an 
eligible individual. However, a de pendent child may live outside of Massachusetts to attend school as long 
as they have not moved out of Massachusetts permanently. “Eligible dependents” include the subscriber’s  
(or subscriber’s  spouse’s) children until the end of the calenda r month in which the ch ild turns age 26. To 
be an eligible dependent, the child is not required to live with the subscriber  or the subscriber’s  spouse, be 
a dependent on the subscriber’s  or spouse’s tax return, or be a full-time student. These eligible dependents 
may include: 
 A newborn child. The effective date  of coverage for a newborn child will be the child’s date of birth 
provided that the subscriber  formally notifies Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue within 30 days of 
the date of birth. (A claim for a member’s  maternity admission may be considered by Blue Cross Blue 
Shield HMO Blue to be this notice when the subscriber’s  coverage is a family plan.) This health plan 
provides coverage for newborn infants for injury and sickness. This includes the necessary care and 
treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defect s, birth abnormalities, and premature birth. The 
coverage for these services is subject to a ll of the provisions of this health plan. 
 An adopted child. The effective date  of coverage for an adopted child  will be the date of placement of 
the child with the subscriber  for the purpose of adoption. The effective date  of coverage for an 
adoptive child who has been living with the subscriber  and for whom the subscriber  has been getting 
foster care payments will be the date the petition to adopt is filed. If the subscriber  is enrolled under a 
family plan as of the date they assume custody of a child for the purpose of  adoption, the child’s 
health care services for injury or sickness will be c overed from the date of custody. (This coverage is 
provided without a waiting period or pre-existing condition restriction.) This includes the necessary 
care and treatment of medically diagnosed congen ital defects, birth abnormalities, and premature 
birth. The coverage for these services is subject to  all of the provisions of this health plan. 
 A newborn infant of an enrolled dependent child immediately from the moment of birth and 
continuing after, until the enrolled dependent child is no longer eligible as a dependent. 
If an eligible dependent child is married, the dependent child can enroll for coverage under the subscriber’s 
individual contract . And, as long as that enrolled child is an eligible dependent, their children are also 
eligible for coverage under the subscriber’s individual contract . The dependent child’s spouse is not 
eligible to enroll as a dependent for coverage under the subscriber’s individual contract . Part 12 – Individual Policy  (continued) 
WORDS IN ITALICS ARE EXPLAINED IN PART 2. 
 Page 104 An eligible dependent may also include: 
 A person under age 26 who is not the subscriber’s  (or the subscriber’s  spouse’s) child but who 
qualifies as a dependent of the subscriber  under the Internal Revenue Code. When the dependent 
loses their dependent status under the Internal Reve nue Code, that dependent  will continue to be 
eligible as a dependent for coverage  in this health plan under the subscriber’s  individual contract  for 
two years after the end of the calendar year in which they last qualified as a dependent under the 
Internal Revenue Code or until the depende nt turns age 26, whichever comes first. 
 A child recognized under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order as having the right to enroll for 
health care coverage. 
 A disabled dependent child  age 26 or older. A dependent child who is mentally or physically 
incapable of earning their own living and who is enrolled under the subscriber’s individual contract  
will continue to be covered after they woul d otherwise lose dependent eligibility under the 
subscriber’s individual contract , so long as the child continues to be mentally or physically incapable 
of earning their own living. In this case, the subscriber  must make arrangements with Blue Cross 
Blue Shield HMO Blue not more than 30 days after the date the child would normally lose eligibility. 
Also, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue must be given any medical or other information that it may 
need to determine if the child can maintain  coverage in this health plan under the subscriber’s  
individual contract . From time to time, Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue may conduct reviews that 
will require a statement from the attending physician. This is to confirm that the child is still an 
eligible disabled dependent child. 
Important Reminder: The eligibility provisions for dependents that  are described in this section may differ 
from the federal tax laws that de fine who may qualify as a dependent.
