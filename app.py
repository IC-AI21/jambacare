    Welcome to the [AI21](https://www.ai21.com/) JambaCare App! This tool empowers you to quickly compare healthcare plans. 
             
    With the help of the [Jamba-1.5-Large model](https://www.ai21.com/jamba), you can pose specific questions to guide your decision-making process. Whether your focus is on out-of-pocket costs, prescription coverage, or options for families, this app facilitates the comparison of up to two plans simultaneously!

    By utilizing Jamba 1.5 from AI21, you benefit from its ability to handle long context inputs of up to 256k tokens. This capability is particularly advantageous when comparing extensive healthcare plans, ensuring you receive thorough and comprehensive insights tailored to your needs.

    For more information about specific plans, you can access the [coverage policy documents here](https://www.bluecrossma.org/myblue/learn-and-save/plans-and-benefits/coverage-policy-documents). Each one of these plans is hundreds of pages long and dense with detail. Jamba 1.5 helps you quickly navigate and compare the key details.
